## Infections in Persons Who Inject Drugs (PWID)

**Q:** What are the common infections, microbiology, and management challenges in persons who inject drugs (PWID)?

**A:**

**Common Infections in Hospitalized PWID:**

| Infection Type | Prevalence | Key Organisms | Notes |
|----------------|-----------|---------------|-------|
| **Bacteremia** | **31%** | MSSA/MRSA (60-90%), *Serratia marcescens* | Often from endocarditis or deep-seated infection |
| **Endocarditis** | **29%** | **S. aureus** (70-90%), *Serratia*, *Candida*, polymicrobial | Right-sided (tricuspid) > left-sided; MRSA increasing |
| **Abscess** | **29%** | MSSA/MRSA, anaerobes, polymicrobial | Neck, groin, extremities; require I&D + antibiotics |
| **Cellulitis** | **20%** | MSSA/MRSA, β-hemolytic strep | Often polymicrobial if chronic wounds |
| **Sepsis** | **10%** | MSSA/MRSA, gram-negatives | High mortality; often from endocarditis, osteomyelitis |
| **Osteomyelitis** | **9%** | MSSA/MRSA, *Serratia*, *Pseudomonas* | Vertebral osteomyelitis common (epidural abscess risk) |
| **Septic arthritis** | **8%** | MSSA/MRSA, *Serratia* | Sternoclavicular, sacroiliac, axial joints |
| **Discitis** | **2%** | MSSA/MRSA | Spinal epidural abscess complication |

**Microbiology Highlights:**

**MRSA:**
- **16.3× higher rate** of invasive MRSA in PWID vs general population
- Incidence increased from **4.1% (2011) → 9.2% (2016)**
- Causes endocarditis, osteomyelitis, skin/soft tissue infections

***Serratia marcescens***:
- **Classic PWID organism** (contaminated injection equipment, water)
- Causes septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis
- Often underappreciated but highly associated with injection drug use

**Clinical Outcomes:**
- **33%** admitted to ICU
- **36%** require surgery (valve replacement, I&D, spinal decompression)
- **12%** leave against medical advice (AMA)
- **9%** mortality

**Management Challenges:**

| Challenge | Considerations |
|-----------|---------------|
| **AMA discharges** | Leads to treatment failure, relapse, mortality; requires harm-reduction approach |
| **OPAT** (outpatient parenteral antibiotics) | Controversial; requires multidisciplinary team, addiction medicine, social work |
| **Surgery timing** | Valve replacement often deferred due to concern for reinfection; requires individualized assessment |
| **Addiction treatment** | **Medication-assisted treatment (MAT)** (buprenorphine, methadone) reduces infection risk |
| **Social determinants** | Housing instability, lack of health insurance, stigma → poor follow-up |

**Harm Reduction Strategies:**
- **Needle exchange programs**: Reduce HIV, HCV, bacterial infection risk
- **Safer injection practices**: Clean skin, use sterile water (not tap/river water), avoid licking needles
- **MAT**: Buprenorphine, methadone, naltrexone reduce injection frequency
- **Wound care clinics**: Early abscess drainage prevents endocarditis, osteomyelitis

**Endocarditis in PWID - Unique Considerations:**
- **Right-sided (tricuspid) endocarditis**: More common in PWID; better prognosis than left-sided
- **Surgery indications**: Refractory heart failure, persistent bacteremia (>7 days), septic emboli, large vegetations (>20 mm)
- **Shorter IV therapy**: Some right-sided MRSA endocarditis can be treated with 2 weeks IV + 2 weeks PO (vs 6 weeks IV)
- **Valve replacement**: Not contraindication if active use, but requires addiction medicine involvement

**Key Points:**
- **S. aureus** (MSSA/MRSA) causes 60-90% of PWID infections
- ***Serratia marcescens***: Classic PWID organism (septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis)
- **MRSA** incidence doubled (4.1% → 9.2%) from 2011-2016
- **12% AMA** discharge rate → high treatment failure
- **Harm reduction** + **MAT** reduce infection risk

**Mnemonic - "PWID = S. aureus (MRSA rising) + Serratia (Septic joints, Spine)"**

**Pearl:** PWID have 16.3× higher invasive MRSA infections (doubled 2011-2016). *Serratia marcescens* is classic PWID organism (septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis). Right-sided endocarditis more common in PWID with better prognosis than left-sided. 12% AMA discharge rate leads to poor outcomes. Harm reduction (needle exchange, MAT) reduces infection risk. Surgery not contraindicated in active users but requires multidisciplinary approach.
