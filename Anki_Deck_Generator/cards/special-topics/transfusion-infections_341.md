## Transfusion- and Transplant-Transmitted Infections

**Q:** What are the key transfusion-transmitted infections, screening methods, and residual transmission risks in 2024?

**A:**

**Mandatory Screening (2024):**

| Pathogen | Screening Test | Residual Risk (US) | Window Period Reduction |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **HIV-1/2** | Antibody + antigen + NAT (nucleic acid testing) | **1 in 1.5 million** | NAT detects acute infection (window: 9-11 days vs 22 days for serology) |
| **Hepatitis B (HBV)** | HBsAg + anti-HBc + NAT | **1 in 220,000-1.2 million** | NAT reduces window to ~20 days (vs 50-60 days for HBsAg alone) |
| **Hepatitis C (HCV)** | Anti-HCV antibody + NAT | **1 in 1.1 million** | NAT detects acute infection (window: 7-10 days) |
| **HTLV-I/II** | Antibody | Rare | - |
| **West Nile Virus** | NAT (seasonal screening) | ~1 in 4 million | - |
| **Zika Virus** | NAT (endemic areas) | Rare | - |
| **Syphilis** | Serologic (RPR/VDRL or treponemal) | Rare | - |

**High-Risk Viral Infections:**

**Cytomegalovirus (CMV):**
- **Transmission**: Via white blood cells (leukocyte-associated)
- **Risk groups**: Immunocompromised (transplant, HIV), neonates, pregnant women
- **Prevention**: **Leukoreduction** (filtration of WBCs) or CMV-seronegative blood
- **Residual risk**: ~1-3% with leukoreduction

**Bacterial Contamination:**
- **Highest risk**: **Platelet transfusions** (stored at room temperature 20-24°C)
- **Organisms**: Skin flora (coagulase-negative staph, *Propionibacterium*), gram-negatives (*E. coli, Serratia, Pseudomonas*)
- **Incidence**: 1 in 1,000-3,000 platelet units
- **Clinical**: Fever, rigors, septic shock during/immediately after transfusion
- **Prevention**: Bacterial culture of platelet units; pathogen reduction technology

**Parasitic Infections:**
- **Malaria**: Rare in US (donor travel history screening)
- **Babesiosis**: Endemic areas (Northeast US); consider in immunocompromised with fever post-transfusion
- **Chagas disease** (*T. cruzi*): Screened in US since 2007; risk 1 in 25,000-30,000

**Emerging Pathogens:**
- **Parvovirus B19**: Not routinely screened; can cause aplastic crisis in sickle cell, hemolytic anemia
- **HAV, HEV**: Rare; HAV screening not routine; HEV of concern in Europe
- **Prions** (vCJD): Donor deferral for UK travel (1980-1996)

**Transplant-Specific Infections:**
- **Donor-derived**: HIV, HBV, HCV, CMV, EBV, toxoplasmosis, strongyloidiasis, rabies (rare)
- **Screening**: All donors screened for HIV, HBV, HCV, CMV, EBV, syphilis, HTLV, WNV
- **CMV**: Major concern in seronegative recipients (especially lung/stem cell transplants)
- **Donor risk assessment**: Social/behavioral history, travel, endemic exposures

**Key Points:**
- **NAT** (nucleic acid testing) dramatically reduced window period for HIV, HBV, HCV
- **Bacterial contamination** is now the most common transfusion-transmitted infection (platelets)
- **CMV prevention**: Leukoreduction or CMV-negative blood for high-risk recipients
- **Residual risk**: HIV/HCV <1 in 1 million; HBV ~1 in 220,000-1.2 million

**Mnemonic - "Transfusion Testing = NAT for HIV, HBV, HCV (Nucleic Acid Testing reduces window)"**

**Pearl:** Bacterial contamination (especially in platelet transfusions) is now the most common transfusion-transmitted infection. CMV prevented by leukoreduction (filters WBCs). NAT screening for HIV, HBV, HCV reduces window period and residual risk to <1 in 1 million (HIV/HCV) or ~1 in 220,000-1.2 million (HBV). Mandatory screening includes HIV, HBV, HCV, HTLV, WNV, Zika (endemic areas), and syphilis.
