## Kawasaki Disease: Coronary Artery Complications

**Q:** What are the coronary artery complications of Kawasaki disease, how are they monitored, and what is the long-term management?

**A:**

**Major Complication: Coronary Artery Aneurysms (CAA)**

**Incidence:**
- **Untreated:** 25% develop CAA
- **Treated with IVIG (<10 days):** <5% develop CAA
- Goal of treatment: Prevent CAA

**Coronary Aneurysm Classification:**

| **Size** | **Z-score** | **Absolute Diameter** | **Risk** |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|----------|
| **Small** | 2.5 to <5 | <5 mm | Lower risk of thrombosis |
| **Medium** | 5 to <10 | 5-8 mm | Moderate risk |
| **Giant** | ≥10 | **≥8 mm** | **High risk:** Thrombosis, MI, stenosis, death |

**Echo Monitoring Schedule:**

| **Timing** | **Purpose** |
|------------|-------------|
| **At diagnosis** | Baseline (often normal initially) |
| **2 weeks** | Detect early aneurysms |
| **6-8 weeks** | Confirm resolution or document persistent CAA |
| **If CAA present** | Serial echo (frequency based on severity) |

**Long-Term Management by CAA Severity:**

**1. No CAA (or Resolved):**
- Low-dose aspirin **discontinued at 6-8 weeks**
- Cardiovascular risk assessment at 5-year intervals
- Return to normal activities

**2. Small/Medium CAA:**
- Continue **low-dose aspirin indefinitely**
- Stress testing periodically (adolescence onward)
- Activity restrictions based on risk

**3. Giant CAA (≥8 mm):**
- **Lifelong anticoagulation** (warfarin or LMWH) + aspirin
- **High risk:** MI, thrombosis, sudden death
- Stress testing, coronary angiography
- May require revascularization (CABG, PCI)

**Complications of CAA:**

| **Complication** | **Mechanism** | **Timing** |
|------------------|---------------|------------|
| **Thrombosis** | Stasis in aneurysm, ↑ platelets | Acute/subacute phase |
| **Stenosis** | Myointimal proliferation | Months to years |
| **Myocardial infarction** | Thrombosis or stenosis | Any time (even years later) |
| **Sudden cardiac death** | MI, arrhythmia | Rare but possible |

**Risk Factors for CAA:**
- Delayed IVIG treatment (>10 days)
- IVIG-resistant disease
- Age <1 year or >8 years
- Male gender
- Prolonged fever
- Elevated inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR)

**Mnemonic: "Giant aneurysms (≥8mm) = Great risk, need Anticoagulation for Life"**
- **G**iant = ≥8 mm
- **G**reat risk
- **A**nticoagulation
- **L**ife (lifelong)

**Clinical Pearls:**
- **Giant CAA = worst prognosis:** 50% risk of thrombosis without anticoagulation
- Patients with KD history need cardiology follow-up even if no CAA (endothelial dysfunction possible)
- **CAA can regress:** Small/medium may remodel over years, but giant rarely resolve
- Consider **cardiac catheterization** for giant CAA to assess coronary flow/stenosis

**Late Presentation:**
- Some patients present in adulthood with MI → found to have CAA from undiagnosed childhood KD
- Always ask about childhood illnesses in young MI patients
