## Question

How is tuberculosis diagnosed? Use the **"AFB Smear → NAAT (GeneXpert) → Culture"** framework.

## Answer

### **Diagnostic Approach:**

**Active TB (Pulmonary):**

1. **AFB Smear (3 sputum samples)**
   - **Rapid** (same day), **low sensitivity** (50-60%)
   - Positive = presumptive TB (start treatment)
   - Does NOT distinguish TB from NTM

2. **Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT/GeneXpert MTB/RIF)**
   - **2-hour test**, detects TB + rifampin resistance
   - **Sensitivity 95-98%** (smear-positive), **70-80%** (smear-negative)
   - **Confirms TB diagnosis**

3. **Culture (gold standard)**
   - Takes **2-6 weeks** (liquid media) or **4-8 weeks** (solid media)
   - **Most sensitive** (80-85%)
   - Required for drug susceptibility testing (DST)

### **Latent TB Infection (LTBI) Testing:**

**Tuberculin Skin Test (TST):**
- **Positive cutoffs:**
  - **≥5mm:** HIV+, close contacts, immunosuppressed, CXR with old TB
  - **≥10mm:** Healthcare workers, immigrants (<5 years), high-risk populations
  - **≥15mm:** No risk factors

**Interferon-Gamma Release Assays (IGRAs):**
- **QuantiFERON-TB Gold**, **T-SPOT.TB**
- **Advantages:** No return visit, not affected by BCG vaccine
- **Preferred** in BCG-vaccinated patients

## Key Points

### **When to Test for LTBI:**
- Close contacts of active TB
- Healthcare workers (baseline + annual if high-risk)
- Immunosuppressed (HIV, TNF-α inhibitors, transplant candidates)
- Immigrants from high-burden countries (<5 years)
- CXR with old healed TB

### **Active TB vs LTBI:**
- **Active TB:** Symptoms (cough >2 weeks, fever, night sweats, weight loss), abnormal CXR, positive AFB/NAAT/culture
- **LTBI:** Asymptomatic, positive TST/IGRA, normal CXR, negative AFB

### **Clinical Pearls:**
- **GeneXpert** detects TB + rifampin resistance in 2 hours
- **Culture required** for full drug susceptibility testing
- **IGRA preferred** over TST in BCG-vaccinated patients
- **3 sputum samples** improve AFB smear sensitivity
- **Cannot distinguish** active from latent TB with TST/IGRA alone
