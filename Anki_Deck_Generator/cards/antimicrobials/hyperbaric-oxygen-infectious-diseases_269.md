## Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) in Infectious Diseases

**Q:** What are the UHMS-approved infectious disease indications for hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and what is the mechanism of antimicrobial action?

**A:**

**Mechanism (at 2-3 ATA, 100% O₂):**
- ↑ Tissue oxygen tension **10-fold** (>250 mmHg)
- **Halts alpha toxin production** by *Clostridium* spp. (requires >250 mmHg pO₂)
- ↑ Neutrophil function (oxidative burst, phagocytosis)
- Generates **reactive oxygen species (ROS)** → bacteriostatic/bactericidal effects (aerobes + anaerobes)
- ↓ Tissue edema, ↑ angiogenesis, wound healing

**UHMS-Approved Infectious Indications:**
1. **Clostridial myonecrosis (gas gangrene)** - critical adjunct
2. **Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTI)** - including necrotizing fasciitis, Fournier's gangrene
3. **Chronic refractory osteomyelitis**
4. **Intracranial abscess** (adjunctive)
5. **Mucormycosis** (adjunctive)

**Clinical Outcomes (Necrotizing Fasciitis):**
- **↓ Mortality:** 52% relative risk reduction (RR 0.522, 95% CI 0.403-0.677)
- Fournier's gangrene mortality: 9.1% with HBOT vs. 22.6% without

**Key Principle:** HBOT is **ADJUNCTIVE only** - requires concurrent surgical debridement + antimicrobials

**Pearl:** Cannot achieve tissue pO₂ >250 mmHg without hyperbaric conditions.
