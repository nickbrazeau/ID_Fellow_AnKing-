## Fluoroquinolone Mechanism and Resistance

**Q:** What is the mechanism of action of fluoroquinolones, and what are the primary resistance mechanisms?

**A:**

**Mechanism of Action:**
Fluoroquinolones inhibit bacterial DNA synthesis by targeting two type II topoisomerases:

1. **DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II)**
   - Primary target in **Gram-negatives**
   - Introduces negative supercoils in DNA (relieves tension during replication)

2. **Topoisomerase IV**
   - Primary target in **Gram-positives**
   - Separates daughter DNA molecules after replication

**Result:** DNA strand breaks → cell death (bactericidal)

**Resistance Mechanisms:**

| **Mechanism** | **Type** | **Details** |
|---------------|----------|-------------|
| **Chromosomal mutations** | Target modification | *gyrA, gyrB* (DNA gyrase), *parC, parE* (topoisomerase IV) |
| **Plasmid-mediated** | Efflux pumps | *qnr* genes (protect enzymes from FQ) |
| **Plasmid-mediated** | Drug modification | *aac(6')-Ib-cr* (acetylates ciprofloxacin) |
| **Plasmid-mediated** | Efflux | *qepA, oqxAB* (active efflux) |

**Key Points:**
- **Chromosomal mutations** are most common (stepwise accumulation)
- First mutation in *gyrA* → reduced susceptibility
- Second mutation in *parC* → high-level resistance
- **Cross-resistance** within class common
- Plasmid-mediated resistance increasingly prevalent worldwide

**Mnemonic: "FQ TWISTs DNA to kill bacteria"**
- **F**Q = Fluoroquinolones
- **T**opo IV and DNA gyrase
- **W**ork by causing breaks
- **I**nhibit replication
- **S**upercoiling disrupted
- **T**arget modification = resistance

**Clinical Pearl:**
- Once resistance develops, difficult to reverse (mutations are permanent)
- Avoid monotherapy in serious Pseudomonas infections (resistance develops rapidly)
