## Question

What is metronidazole's mechanism of action, and why does it only work against **anaerobic organisms**?

## Answer

### **Mechanism of Action (Nitroreduction):**

**Step 1: Prodrug Activation (Anaerobic Metabolism Required)**
- Metronidazole is a **prodrug** (inactive form)
- Requires **reduction of 5-nitroimidazole group** to become active
- Only occurs in organisms with **low redox potential** (anaerobes)

**Step 2: Active Metabolite Formation**
- Reduced by bacterial nitroreductases and ferredoxin
- Forms **nitroso free radicals** and other reactive intermediates

**Step 3: DNA Damage**
- Reactive metabolites cause **DNA strand breaks**
- Disrupts DNA helix structure
- Inhibits DNA synthesis → **bactericidal effect**

### **Why Only Anaerobes?**

| Feature | Anaerobes | Aerobes |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Redox potential** | Low (-400 mV) | High (positive) |
| **Drug activation** | YES (nitroreduction occurs) | NO (drug stays inactive) |
| **Ferredoxin/nitroreductase** | Present | Absent/insufficient |
| **Metronidazole effect** | Bactericidal | No effect |

**Key Concept:** Metronidazole is **selectively toxic** because only anaerobes have the enzymatic machinery to activate it.

### **Pharmacology:**

| Parameter | Value | Clinical Implication |
|-----------|-------|---------------------|
| **Bioavailability (PO)** | ~100% | PO = IV (use PO when possible) |
| **CNS penetration** | Excellent (CSF:serum ~100%) | Good for brain abscesses |
| **Protein binding** | <20% | High free drug levels |
| **Elimination** | Hepatic metabolism (60-80%) | Dose reduce in severe liver disease |
| **Half-life** | 6-8 hours | TID or BID dosing |

## Key Points

### **Concentration-Dependent Killing:**
- Higher doses → better killing
- Post-antibiotic effect (PAE) present

### **Resistance Mechanisms (Rare):**
- **Decreased nitroreductase activity** → less drug activation
- **Increased DNA repair** → overcome DNA damage
- **Efflux pumps** → reduced intracellular concentration

### **Clinical Pearls:**
- **No activity against aerobes** (cannot activate drug)
- **PO bioavailability = IV** → prefer PO route (cheaper, easier)
- **Excellent tissue penetration** including CNS, abscesses
- Use IV only if patient NPO or malabsorption

### **Special Populations:**
- **Pregnancy:** Category B (use if needed, avoid 1st trimester if possible)
- **Renal dysfunction:** No dose adjustment needed
- **Hepatic dysfunction:** Reduce dose 50% if severe cirrhosis
- **Hemodialysis:** Supplemental dose needed (removed by dialysis)
