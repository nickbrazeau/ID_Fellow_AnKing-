## Question

What defines an **Extended-Spectrum β-Lactamase (ESBL)**, and what are the three most common ESBL gene families?

## Answer

### Definition:
ESBLs are **Bush-Jacoby Group 2be** enzymes that:
- Hydrolyze oxyimino-cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone)
- Hydrolyze aztreonam
- Are **inhibited by clavulanate**
- Do NOT reliably hydrolyze cephamycins (cefoxitin) or carbapenems

### Three Major ESBL Gene Families:

| Gene Family | Key Features |
|-------------|--------------|
| **CTX-M** | Most prevalent worldwide; preferentially hydrolyzes cefotaxime > ceftazidime |
| **TEM** | TEM-1 is most common; ESBL variants include TEM-3, TEM-10, TEM-26 |
| **SHV** | Derived from *Klebsiella*; SHV-1 is parent, ESBL variants include SHV-2, SHV-5 |

### Clinical Pearl:
- **CTX-M-15** is the dominant ESBL globally (especially ST131 *E. coli*)
- Often co-transferred with aminoglycoside resistance genes on plasmids

## Key Points

- ESBLs confer resistance to ALL penicillins and cephalosporins (except cephamycins)
- Carbapenems remain reliable treatment (ertapenem, meropenem)
- Avoid cephalosporins even if in vitro susceptible (inoculum effect)
