## Question

What are the four main mechanisms by which bacteria develop antibiotic resistance? (Use the **LIME** mnemonic)

## Answer

**LIME mnemonic:**

- **L**imiting drug uptake (reduced permeability/porins)
- **I**nactivating drugs (enzymatic degradation)
- **M**odifying drug targets (altered PBPs, ribosomes)
- **E**ffluxing drugs actively (pump systems)

### Examples:
1. **Limiting uptake:** Gram-negatives reduce porin channels (e.g., carbapenem resistance)
2. **Inactivating drugs:** β-lactamases hydrolyze β-lactam ring
3. **Modifying targets:** *mecA* gene → PBP2a (MRSA)
4. **Efflux pumps:** AcrAB-TolC in *E. coli* exports multiple drug classes

## Key Points

- These mechanisms can coexist in the same organism
- Often encoded on mobile genetic elements (plasmids, transposons)
- Efflux pumps are particularly problematic due to multi-drug substrate range
