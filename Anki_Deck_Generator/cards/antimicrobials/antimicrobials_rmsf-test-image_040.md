## Question

What is the characteristic **timing and distribution** of the rash in Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF)?

## Answer

### **Timing:**
- Appears **2-4 days** after fever onset
- **<50% have rash** in first 3 days (when most seek care)
- **Petechiae develop day 5-6** (sign of severe disease)
- **90% eventually develop rash** during illness

### **Distribution Pattern:**
1. **Starts** at wrists, forearms, and ankles (centripetal)
2. **Spreads centrally** to trunk
3. **Involves palms and soles** (classic but late finding - 50-80% of cases)
4. Initially **maculopapular** → becomes **petechial** (non-blanching)

### **Clinical Pearl:**
- **Do NOT wait for rash to treat** - start doxycycline empirically if suspected
- Absence of rash does NOT rule out RMSF
- Rash is often **absent or delayed** in dark-skinned patients

## Key Points

### **Mnemonic: "Wrists-Ankles-First, Palms-Soles-Last"**

### **Treatment:**
- Doxycycline 100mg PO/IV BID for **all ages** (including children <8 years)
- Start empirically if tick exposure + fever in endemic area
- Do NOT delay for lab confirmation (serology negative early)

### **Mortality:**
- Untreated: 20-30%
- Treated early (<5 days): <5%
- Petechial rash = severe disease with higher mortality risk
