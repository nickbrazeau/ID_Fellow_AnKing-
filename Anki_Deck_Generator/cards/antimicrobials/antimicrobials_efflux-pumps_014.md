## Question

What are the five major families of bacterial efflux pumps, and which is most clinically significant in Gram-negative multidrug resistance? (Use **PRAMS** mnemonic)

## Answer

**PRAMS mnemonic for efflux pump families:**

| Family | Energy Source | Clinical Examples |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| **P**ace (ABC) | ATP-binding cassette | LmrA in *S. aureus* |
| **R**ND | Proton motive force | **AcrAB-TolC** in *E. coli* (most important) |
| **A**ME (MATE) | Na⁺ or H⁺ gradient | NorM in *Neisseria* |
| **M**FS | Proton motive force | QacA in *S. aureus* |
| **S**MR | Proton motive force | EmrE in *E. coli* |

## Key Points

### **RND Family = Most Clinically Significant:**
- **AcrAB-TolC** in *E. coli* and *P. aeruginosa* (MexAB-OprM)
- Multi-component spanning inner membrane, periplasm, and outer membrane
- Exports fluoroquinolones, β-lactams, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol

### **Clinical Implications:**
- Constitutive expression causes intrinsic resistance
- Overexpression from mutations → multi-drug resistance
- Efflux pump inhibitors under investigation (no FDA-approved agents yet)

### **Co-resistance Pattern:**
- Aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes often on same plasmids as KPCs/ESBLs
- If aminoglycoside resistance noted → suspect ESBL/carbapenemase
