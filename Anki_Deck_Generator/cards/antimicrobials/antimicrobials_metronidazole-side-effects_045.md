## Question

What are the major **side effects and toxicities** of metronidazole, including the disulfiram-like reaction?

## Answer

### **Common Side Effects (>10%):**

| Side Effect | Frequency | Management |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| **Nausea/vomiting** | 10-30% | Take with food |
| **Metallic taste** | 10-20% | Self-limited, warn patient |
| **GI upset** | 10-15% | Take with food |

### **Serious Toxicities:**

#### **1. Disulfiram-Like Reaction (ALDH Inhibition):**

**Mechanism:** Metronidazole inhibits **aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)** → accumulation of acetaldehyde when alcohol consumed

**Symptoms:**
- Flushing, headache
- Nausea, vomiting
- Tachycardia, hypotension
- Abdominal cramping

**Prevention:**
- **Avoid alcohol during treatment + 72 hours after last dose**
- Includes oral/topical alcohol, mouthwash, alcohol-based hand sanitizer

#### **2. Peripheral Neuropathy:**

**Risk Factors:**
- **Cumulative dose** (>2g/day or >4 weeks duration)
- Most common with prolonged therapy

**Presentation:**
- Paresthesias (hands/feet)
- Numbness, tingling
- May be **irreversible** if not caught early

**Management:** Discontinue immediately if symptoms develop

#### **3. CNS Toxicity (Rare):**

**Symptoms:**
- Ataxia, dysarthria
- Seizures
- Encephalopathy
- **Cerebellar syndrome**

**MRI Finding:** Symmetric T2 hyperintensity in **dentate nuclei** (pathognomonic)

**Reversibility:** Usually reversible with discontinuation

### **Other Notable Effects:**

| Effect | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| **Darkened urine** | Harmless metabolite |
| **QTc prolongation** | Monitor if other QT drugs |
| **Pancreatitis** | Rare |
| ***C. difficile* overgrowth** | Paradoxical (rare) |

## Key Points

### **Clinical Pearls:**
- Peripheral neuropathy risk increases with **cumulative dose >30-40g total**
- Disulfiram reaction can occur with **any alcohol exposure** (oral, topical, IV)
- CNS toxicity more common in elderly and renal dysfunction
- Metallic taste does NOT require discontinuation

### **Patient Counseling:**
- Avoid all alcohol during therapy + 72 hours after
- Report numbness/tingling immediately
- Metallic taste is expected and harmless
- Urine may turn dark brown (harmless)

### **Contraindications:**
- First trimester pregnancy (avoid if possible)
- Concurrent disulfiram use
- Known metronidazole hypersensitivity
