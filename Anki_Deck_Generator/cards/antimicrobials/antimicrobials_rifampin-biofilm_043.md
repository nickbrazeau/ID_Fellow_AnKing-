## Question

Why is **rifampin essential** for treating prosthetic joint infections (PJI) and other device-related infections? When should it NOT be used?

## Answer

### **Why Rifampin for Biofilm Infections:**

**Unique Properties:**
1. **Penetrates biofilms** (most antibiotics cannot)
2. **High intracellular levels** (kills intracellular bacteria)
3. **Kills non-replicating (sessile) bacteria** in biofilm
4. **Most essential agent** for staphylococcal device infections

### **Clinical Uses for Biofilm:**

| Indication | Regimen | Duration |
|------------|---------|----------|
| **Prosthetic joint infection (PJI)** | Rifampin + companion drug* | 3-6 months |
| **Prosthetic valve endocarditis** | Rifampin + vancomycin + gentamicin | 6 weeks |
| **Cardiac device infection (CIED)** | Rifampin + anti-staph agent | 4-6 weeks (after device removal) |
| **Vascular graft infection** | Rifampin + anti-staph agent | Variable |

*Companion drugs: Fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin), minocycline, or β-lactam

### **When NOT to Use Rifampin:**

❌ **Non-device staphylococcal infections:**
- Native valve endocarditis (controversial, not routinely recommended)
- Bacteremia without device
- Osteomyelitis without hardware
- Soft tissue infections

**Rationale:** Current evidence suggests rifampin does NOT improve outcomes in non-implant staph infections and may increase side effects

## Key Points

### **Key Principles:**
- **NEVER use as monotherapy** (rapid resistance within 48 hours)
- **Always combine** with companion drug with anti-staph activity
- Start rifampin **after bloodstream clearance** (usually after 3-5 days of IV therapy)
- **Debridement/hardware retention** required for success

### **Rifampin Resistance:**
- Develops via single point mutation in *rpoB* gene (RNA polymerase)
- Occurs rapidly if used alone or with inadequate companion therapy
- Check susceptibility before starting treatment

### **Companion Drug Selection:**
- **Fluoroquinolone** (levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin) - most common
- **Minocycline** - alternative if FQ resistance
- **Daptomycin** - IV option but antagonism reported with rifampin
- Avoid rifampin + daptomycin combination (conflicting data on antagonism)
