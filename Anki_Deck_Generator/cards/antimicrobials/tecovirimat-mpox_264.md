## Tecovirimat (TPOXX): Mechanism and Clinical Use

**Q:** What is the mechanism of action of tecovirimat, and what is its FDA approval status for mpox (monkeypox)?

**A:**

**Mechanism:**
- Inhibits viral **p37 protein** (encoded by F13 gene)
- p37 required for **intracellular mature virus (IMV) → intracellular enveloped virus (IEV)** formation
- Blocks viral dissemination from infection site
- **Highly conserved target** across orthopoxviruses (smallpox, mpox, cowpox)

**FDA Approval Status (2024):**
- **FDA-approved ONLY for smallpox** (July 2018)
- **NO FDA approval for mpox**
- Available for mpox via **Expanded Access IND (EA-IND)** only

**STOMP Trial Results (Dec 2024):**
- **Did NOT reduce** time to lesion resolution or pain in clade II mpox
- Trial closed due to lack of efficacy in mild-moderate disease

**International Use:**
- **EU approved** (Jan 2022) for orthopoxvirus diseases including mpox
- **Japan approved** (2024) for smallpox, mpox, cowpox

**Pearl:** Efficacy unclear in clade I mpox or severe disease.
