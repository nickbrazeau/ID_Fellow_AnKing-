## IVIG in Infectious Diseases: Mechanisms and Indications

**Q:** What are the mechanisms of action of IVIG, and what are the key infectious disease indications?

**A:**

**Mechanisms:**
- **Neutralization** of superantigens (TSS) and pathogenic autoantibodies
- **Fc-mediated** activation of regulatory T cells (Tregs)
- **Inhibition** of TNF-α and inflammatory cytokine release
- **Modulation** of B/T cell function, dendritic cells, neutrophil extracellular traps

**Infectious Disease Indications:**

| Indication | Dose | Efficacy | Evidence |
|------------|------|----------|----------|
| **Kawasaki Disease** | 2 g/kg × 1 + aspirin | ↓ Coronary aneurysm 25-30% → <5% | **Gold standard** |
| **Streptococcal TSS** (+ clindamycin) | 1-2 g/kg total over 1-3 days | ↓ Mortality 33.7% → 15.7% | Adjunctive therapy |
| **Staphylococcal TSS** | 1-2 g/kg | Neutralizes superantigens | Adjunctive |
| **Severe COVID-19** (investigational) | 0.3-0.5 g/kg/day × 3-5 days | Mixed evidence | NOT routinely recommended |

**NOT Recommended:** Routine use in septic shock (guidelines do not support)

**Pearl:** **Fc-enriched IVIG** effective in Kawasaki disease; Fab-enriched preparations ineffective (Fc-Treg activation critical).
