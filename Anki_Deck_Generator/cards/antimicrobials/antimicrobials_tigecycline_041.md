## Question

What is tigecycline's spectrum of activity, and what is the **FDA black box warning** about increased mortality?

## Answer

### **Tigecycline Spectrum (Broadest Tetracycline):**

| Organism Type | Activity |
|---------------|----------|
| **MRSA** | YES (unlike doxycycline) |
| **VRE** | YES (*E. faecalis* and *E. faecium*) |
| **ESBL producers** | YES |
| **Gram-negatives** | Most Enterobacterales |
| **Anaerobes** | Excellent (unlike doxycycline) |
| **Atypicals** | Yes |
| ***Pseudomonas*** | **NO** (intrinsically resistant) |
| ***Proteus*** | **NO** (intrinsically resistant) |

### **FDA Black Box Warning (2013):**

**⚠️ Increased All-Cause Mortality:**
- Meta-analysis: **0.6% absolute increased risk of death** vs comparators (95% CI 0.1-1.2%)
- Tigecycline: 2.5% mortality
- Comparators: 1.8% mortality

**Highest Risk:**
- **Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP):** 19.1% mortality with tigecycline vs 12.3% with comparators
- VAP is NOT an FDA-approved indication

**FDA Recommendation:**
- "**Reserve for situations when alternative treatments are not suitable**"

### **FDA-Approved Indications:**
1. Complicated skin/soft tissue infections (cSSTI)
2. Complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI)
3. Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP)

**NOT approved for:** HAP/VAP, bloodstream infections, diabetic foot

## Key Points

### **Dosing:**
- Loading: 100mg IV × 1
- Maintenance: 50mg IV q12h
- Infuse over 30-60 minutes

### **When to Use:**
- MDR infections (MRSA, VRE, ESBL) when other options contraindicated
- Polymicrobial intra-abdominal infections
- **Last resort only** due to mortality risk

### **Clinical Pearls:**
- Avoid in bacteremia (poor serum levels)
- Nausea/vomiting common (30%)
- Does NOT cover *Pseudomonas* or *Proteus*
- Pregnancy Category D (tooth discoloration)
