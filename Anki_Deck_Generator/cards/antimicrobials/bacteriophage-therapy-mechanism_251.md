## Bacteriophage Therapy: Mechanism and Advantages

**Q:** What is the mechanism of action of lytic bacteriophage therapy, and what are the key advantages over traditional antibiotics? (Use mnemonic **SPARE**)

**A:**

**Mechanism:** Lytic phages inject DNA → hijack bacterial machinery → replicate (50-200 progeny) → produce endolysins/holins → osmotic lysis within 20-40 minutes.

**SPARE Advantages:**
- **S**pecificity: Strain/species-level targeting (preserves microbiome)
- **P**roliferation: Self-amplification at infection site
- **A**daptation: Co-evolution with bacteria (renewable therapy)
- **R**esistance trade-off: Phage resistance may restore antibiotic sensitivity
- **E**nzymes: Direct bacterial lysis via cell wall disruption

*Key limitation:* Narrow spectrum requires phage cocktails for adequate coverage.
