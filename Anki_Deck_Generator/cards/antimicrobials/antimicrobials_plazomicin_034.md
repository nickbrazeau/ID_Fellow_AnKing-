## Plazomicin: Novel Aminoglycoside

**Q:** What is plazomicin, how does it differ from traditional aminoglycosides, and when should it be used?

**A:**

**Classification:**
- Novel **aminoglycoside** with structural modifications
- Designed to resist inactivation by **aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (AMEs)**

**Mechanism Advantage:**
- Structural changes confer **broad activity** against Enterobacterales resistant to:
  - Tobramycin
  - Gentamicin
  - Amikacin
- Resists most AMEs that inactivate traditional aminoglycosides

**Spectrum:**
- **CRE** (carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales)
- **ESBL-producing** Enterobacterales
- **Multidrug-resistant** E. coli, K. pneumoniae
- **Activity:** 99.4% (163/164) of isolates susceptible when **16S rRNA methyltransferases (RMTases) absent**

**Key Limitation:**
- ❌ **NOT active if 16S RMTases present** (68/70 nonsusceptible isolates had ≥1 RMTase gene)
- RMTases: armA, rmtB, rmtC (confer high-level resistance to ALL aminoglycosides including plazomicin)

**FDA-Approved Indication:**
- **Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI)**, including acute pyelonephritis
- Use when limited or no alternative treatment options

**Toxicity Profile:**
- **Less nephrotoxic and ototoxic** than traditional aminoglycosides
- Still requires monitoring (SCr, audiology if prolonged)

**Dosing:**
- 15 mg/kg IV q24h
- Renal dose adjustment required

**Mnemonic: "PLAzomicin = PLAy-safe aminoglycoside"**
- **PLA**y-safe = Less toxic than traditional agents
- But **NOT if RMTases** present

**Clinical Decision:**
- Consider for **CRE cUTI** when:
  - Other agents not suitable (allergy, resistance)
  - Good renal concentration
- Check for **16S RMTase genes** if available (predict resistance)

| **Feature** | **Plazomicin** | **Traditional Aminoglycosides** |
|-------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| **AME resistance** | ✅ Yes (designed to evade) | ❌ No (inactivated) |
| **16S RMTase** | ❌ NOT active | ❌ NOT active |
| **Nephro/ototoxicity** | ↓ Lower | ↑ Higher |
| **Indication** | cUTI | Various |

**Clinical Pearl:**
- **Spare agent** for CRE cUTI when other options exhausted
- Good urinary concentration makes it ideal for UTI
- Not for systemic CRE infections (limited penetration, use beta-lactams)

**Media:** None
