## Bacteriophage Therapy: Clinical Use and FDA Regulation

**Q:** What is the current regulatory status of bacteriophage therapy in the United States, and what clinical evidence supports its use?

**A:**

**FDA Status:**
- **No approved products** for human therapeutic use
- Available only via **Emergency IND/Compassionate Use** (30-day FDA review)
- Requirements: Clinical need, in vitro susceptibility, genetic characterization, sterility (USP 71), minimal endotoxin, **no lysogenic activity**
- >99% of expanded-access applications approved

**Clinical Evidence:**
- ~**90 trials worldwide** (41 in US) - Phase 1/2a
- **70% lower bacterial eradication** with phage monotherapy vs. phage + antibiotics
- Active targets: *P. aeruginosa* (VAP, CF), MDR *E. coli* (UTI), diabetic foot ulcers, bacteremia
- Notable programs: TAILΦR (Baylor), ELIMINATE trial (Locus Biosciences), CF-301/Exebacase (endolysin - Phase III)

*Pearl:* Combination with antibiotics superior to monotherapy.
