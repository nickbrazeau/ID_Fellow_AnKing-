## Nitrofurantoin: Mechanism, Use, and Contraindications

**Q:** What is nitrofurantoin's mechanism, when should it be used, and what are its major contraindications and adverse effects?

**A:**

**Mechanism:**
- Multiple mechanisms (damages bacterial DNA, disrupts protein synthesis)
- Bacteriostatic at low concentrations, bactericidal at high concentrations in urine
- Concentrated in urine → ideal for UTI

**Indications:**
- **Uncomplicated cystitis ONLY**
- ❌ **NOT for pyelonephritis** (poor tissue penetration)
- ❌ **NOT for systemic infections** (low serum levels)

**Spectrum:**
- E. coli, Enterococcus, Staph saprophyticus
- NOT Proteus, Pseudomonas, Serratia

**Dosing:**
- Macrocrystal: 100 mg PO BID x 5-7 days (treatment)
- Prophylaxis: 50-100 mg PO daily at bedtime

**Major Contraindications:**

| **Contraindication** | **Rationale** |
|----------------------|---------------|
| **CrCl <30 mL/min** (FDA cutoff) | Subtherapeutic urinary levels, ↑ systemic accumulation → toxicity |
| **Some say CrCl <60** (traditional) | Recent data: >40 mL/min probably OK for 5-day course |
| **Pyelonephritis** | Inadequate tissue penetration |
| **Age ≥65 years** (Beers Criteria) | ↑ Risk of pulmonary/hepatic toxicity, neuropathy |
| **Pregnancy (term 38-42 weeks)** | Risk of hemolytic anemia in neonate (G6PD) |

**Major Adverse Effects:**

**1. Pulmonary Toxicity:**
- **Acute** (hours-days): Fever, dyspnea, cough, eosinophilia (hypersensitivity)
- **Chronic** (>6 months): Interstitial fibrosis, irreversible (most serious)
- Mechanism: Oxidative stress, immune-mediated, direct cytotoxic

**2. Peripheral Neuropathy:**
- Ascending motor and sensory polyneuropathy
- Can be **severe and irreversible**
- Risk: Renal failure, elderly, DM, B12 deficiency, prolonged use

**3. Other:**
- Hepatotoxicity (acute, chronic)
- GI upset (take with food)
- Hemolytic anemia (G6PD deficiency)

**Mnemonic: "NitroFuran FLIPS the Lungs and Nerves"**
- **F**ibrosis (pulmonary, chronic)
- **L**ungs (acute pneumonitis)
- **I**neffective if CrCl low
- **P**eripheral neuropathy
- **S**top if chronic use (>6 months → fibrosis risk)

**Clinical Pearl:**
- **Beers Criteria:** Avoid in elderly (≥65 years) due to high toxicity risk
- Monitor for pulmonary symptoms (especially with chronic prophylaxis)
- If used long-term (prophylaxis), get baseline CXR and pulmonary function tests
