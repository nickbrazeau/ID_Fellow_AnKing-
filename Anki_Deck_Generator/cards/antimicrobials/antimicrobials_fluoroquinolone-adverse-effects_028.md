## Fluoroquinolone Adverse Effects

**Q:** What are the major adverse effects of fluoroquinolones, and which patients are at highest risk?

**A:**

**Major Adverse Effects:**

**1. QTc Prolongation**
- Risk: Moxifloxacin > Levofloxacin > Ciprofloxacin
- Monitor: Patients with cardiac disease, electrolyte abnormalities, concurrent QT-prolonging drugs
- Can lead to torsades de pointes

**2. Tendon Rupture** (Black Box Warning)
- **Achilles tendon** most common (also rotator cuff, hand, shoulder)
- Onset: Can occur hours to months after starting therapy
- High-risk groups:
  - Age >60 years
  - Concurrent corticosteroid use
  - Transplant recipients (immunosuppression)
  - Kidney, heart, or lung transplants
- Mechanism: Collagen degradation, ↓ tenocyte proliferation

**3. CNS Effects**
- **Seizures** (especially with NSAIDs - lower seizure threshold)
- Dizziness, headache, insomnia, confusion, psychosis
- Risk: Elderly, renal insufficiency, underlying CNS disorders

**4. Dysglycemia**
- Both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia reported
- Risk highest with gatifloxacin (withdrawn from US market)

**5. Peripheral Neuropathy** (Black Box Warning)
- Can be permanent and irreversible
- Paresthesias, pain, numbness, weakness

**6. GI Effects**
- Nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain (common, usually mild)
- C. difficile infection risk

**7. Photosensitivity**
- More common with lomefloxacin, sparfloxacin
- Advise sun protection

**Mnemonic: "FQ TAPES cause problems"**
- **T**endon rupture (Achilles)
- **A**rrhythmias (QTc prolongation)
- **P**eripheral neuropathy
- **E**ncephalopathy (CNS effects, seizures)
- **S**eizures (with NSAIDs)

**Clinical Pearl:**
- STOP fluoroquinolone immediately if tendinitis, tendon pain, or peripheral neuropathy occurs
- Symptoms may persist or become irreversible

**Risk Stratification:**

| **Adverse Effect** | **Highest Risk Groups** |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **Tendon rupture** | >60 yo, steroids, transplant |
| **QTc prolongation** | Cardiac disease, electrolyte abnormalities, moxi > levo > cipro |
| **Seizures** | Elderly, renal insufficiency, NSAIDs |
| **Peripheral neuropathy** | Elderly, prolonged use |
