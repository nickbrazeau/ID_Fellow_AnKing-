## FDA Fluoroquinolone Black Box Warnings

**Q:** What are the FDA black box warnings for fluoroquinolones, and which patients should avoid them?

**A:**

**FDA Black Box Warnings (Chronological):**

**1. July 2008: Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture**
- Increased risk in all age groups
- Highest risk: >60 years, corticosteroids, kidney/heart/lung transplants
- Can occur during or months after treatment
- May be irreversible

**2. May 2016: Disabling and Potentially Permanent Side Effects**
- Encompasses multiple systems:
  - Tendons, muscles, joints
  - Nerves (peripheral neuropathy)
  - Central nervous system
- Should NOT be used for uncomplicated infections when alternatives exist

**3. December 2018: Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection**
- **~2-fold increased risk** of aortic rupture/dissection
- Highest risk in first 60 days of treatment
- Mechanism: MMP activation → collagen degradation in aortic wall

**Patients Who Should Avoid Fluoroquinolones:**

| **Condition** | **Rationale** |
|---------------|---------------|
| **Aortic aneurysm** (known) | ↑ Risk of rupture/dissection |
| **Peripheral atherosclerotic vascular disease** | ↑ Risk of aortic events |
| **Hypertension** (uncontrolled) | ↑ Risk of aortic events |
| **Marfan syndrome** | Connective tissue disorder → ↑ aneurysm risk |
| **Ehlers-Danlos syndrome** | Connective tissue disorder → ↑ aneurysm risk |
| **Elderly patients** | Multiple risk factors converge |
| **History of tendon disorders** | ↑ Risk of tendon rupture |
| **Myasthenia gravis** | Can exacerbate muscle weakness |

**2016 FDA Recommendation:**
- Fluoroquinolones should be **reserved** for patients who have **no alternative treatment options** for:
  - Uncomplicated UTI
  - Acute bacterial sinusitis
  - Acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis

**2024 UK MHRA Guidance:**
- Systemic fluoroquinolones must only be prescribed when other commonly recommended antibiotics are inappropriate

**Mnemonic: "FQ TPAC-A" for Black Box Warnings**
- **T**endon rupture (2008)
- **P**eripheral neuropathy (2016)
- **A**ortic aneurysm/dissection (2018)
- **C**NS effects (2016)
- **A**void in uncomplicated infections (2016)

**Clinical Decision-Making:**
- Risk-benefit analysis required
- Document why alternatives are inappropriate
- Counsel patients on warning signs (tendon pain, chest/back pain, neuropathy symptoms)
