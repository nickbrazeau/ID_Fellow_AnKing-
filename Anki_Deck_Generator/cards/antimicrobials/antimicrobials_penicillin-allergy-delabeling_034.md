## Question

What are the current approaches to **penicillin allergy delabeling** (2024), and when is skin testing vs. direct oral challenge appropriate?

## Answer

### **Key Fact:**
Only **1-10% of patients** with reported penicillin allergy have true IgE-mediated allergy when tested

### **Risk Stratification (PEN-FAST Tool):**

| Risk Category | History | Approach |
|---------------|---------|----------|
| **Low-risk** | Remote history (>10 years), non-severe rash | **Direct oral challenge (DOC)** |
| **Moderate-risk** | Recent reaction, urticaria, unknown timing | Skin testing → oral challenge |
| **High-risk** | Anaphylaxis, recent severe reaction, DRESS/SJS/TEN | Skin testing + allergist evaluation |

### **PEN-FAST Score (≥3 = higher risk):**
- **PEN**icillin allergy
- **F**ive years or less since reaction
- **A**naphylaxis or angioedema
- **S**evere cutaneous reaction (DRESS, SJS/TEN)
- **T**reatment required for reaction

### **Delabeling Approaches (2024 Guidelines):**

| Method | Indication | Safety | NPV |
|--------|-----------|--------|-----|
| **Direct oral challenge (DOC)** | Low-risk patients | 2.3% minor reactions, no anaphylaxis | 95.8% |
| **Skin test → challenge** | Moderate-risk, anaphylaxis history | 11.5% reactions with skin test first | 95-99% |
| **History alone** | Remote, mild, childhood rash | Safe for delabeling | ~95% |

## Key Points

### **2024 AAAAI Position:**
- **ALL clinicians** (not just allergists) can perform delabeling for low-risk patients
- Pharmacist-led and stewardship-driven programs are effective
- Direct oral challenge is safe, cost-effective, and faster than skin testing

### **When to Skin Test:**
- Anaphylaxis history
- Recent IgE-mediated reaction
- Severe reaction requiring hospitalization
- Patient anxiety/preference

### **Direct Oral Challenge Protocol:**
- 10% dose → wait 30 min → 90% dose → observe 1 hour
- Can be done in outpatient or inpatient setting
- Contraindications: Active infection needing PCN, severe prior reaction (DRESS/SJS/TEN)

### **Impact of Delabeling:**
- ↓ Use of broad-spectrum antibiotics
- ↓ *C. difficile* infections
- ↓ VRE and MRSA colonization
- ↓ Hospital costs and length of stay
