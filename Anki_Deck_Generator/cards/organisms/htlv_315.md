## Human T-Lymphotropic Virus (HTLV-1 and HTLV-2)

**Q:** What are the transmission routes and major diseases associated with HTLV-1?

**A:**

**Overview:**
- **Retrovirus** (family Retroviridae; related to HIV but distinct)
- Two main types: **HTLV-1** (more prevalent, more pathogenic) and **HTLV-2** (rarely causes disease)
- **Chronic lifelong infection**
- Majority **asymptomatic** throughout life

**Transmission:**

| Route | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Breastfeeding** (primary) | **20-30% transmission rate**; shorter duration → lower transmission |
| **Sexual contact** | **5:1** male-to-female transmission efficiency |
| **Blood** | Needle sharing, unsafe transfusion; **leukoreduction** reduces risk |

**HTLV-1 Associated Diseases:**

**1. Adult T-Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma (ATL/ATLL):**
- **~4% of infected individuals** develop ATL
- Aggressive T-cell malignancy (CD4+)
- **Long latency**: Typically decades after infection
- Poor prognosis (acute form rapidly fatal)

**2. HTLV-1-Associated Myelopathy/Tropical Spastic Paraparesis (HAM/TSP):**
- **~2% of infected individuals** develop HAM/TSP
- **Chronic inflammatory CNS disease** (demyelination of spinal cord)
- **Clinical features**:
  - **Progressive spastic weakness** of lower limbs
  - Lower back pain
  - **Bowel/bladder dysfunction**
- Risk: Associated with **duration of infection** and **proviral load**

**Other HTLV-1 Associations:**
- Uveitis, infective dermatitis, Strongyloides hyperinfection

**HTLV-2:**
- **Rarely causes disease** (possibly associated with neurologic disease, but less clear than HTLV-1)

**Prevention:**

| Strategy | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| **Maternal-infant** | **Formula feeding** instead of breastfeeding; freeze-thaw breast milk or leukoreduction |
| **Sexual** | Condom use |
| **Blood products** | HTLV-1/2 screening, leukoreduction |

**Treatment:**
- **NO effective treatment** or vaccine for HTLV-1 infection
- Focus on **prevention** and **detection**
- ATL treated with chemotherapy (poor outcomes)
- HAM/TSP: Supportive care, corticosteroids (limited benefit)

**Key Points:**
- Most infected individuals remain **asymptomatic** lifelong
- **4% develop ATL** (decades later); **2% develop HAM/TSP**
- **Breastfeeding** primary transmission route (20-30%)
- NO cure; prevention critical

**Mnemonic - "4-2-1 HTLV"**: **4**% ATL, **2**% HAM/TSP, **1** virus (HTLV-1 most pathogenic)

**Pearl:** HTLV-1 causes two major diseases: ATL (4%, aggressive T-cell lymphoma) and HAM/TSP (2%, progressive spastic paraparesis). Transmitted primarily via breastfeeding (20-30%). No effective treatment—prevention is critical.
