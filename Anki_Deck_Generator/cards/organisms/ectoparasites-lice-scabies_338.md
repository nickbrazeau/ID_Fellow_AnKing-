## Ectoparasites: Pediculosis (Lice) and Scabies

**Q:** What are the treatments for pediculosis and scabies, including crusted (Norwegian) scabies and resistance patterns?

**A:**

**Pediculosis (Head Lice):**

| Treatment | Dosing | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Permethrin 1% cream** | Apply to dry hair, leave 10 min, rinse; **repeat in 7 days** | OTC; first-line but **widespread resistance** (kdr gene in 95% of European lice) |
| **Topical ivermectin 0.5% lotion** | Apply to dry hair/scalp, leave 10 min, rinse; **repeat in 7 days** | More effective than permethrin for resistant lice |
| **Oral ivermectin** | **200 µg/kg PO**; repeat in 7-10 days | Effective against permethrin-resistant lice; **emerging resistance reported** (7.5% treatment failures) |
| **Malathion 0.5% lotion** | Apply to dry hair, leave 8-12h, rinse; repeat in 7-9 days | Effective but flammable; resistance less common |
| **Dimethicone 4%** | Apply to dry hair, leave 8h or overnight, rinse; repeat in 7 days | Non-insecticidal (suffocation); no resistance |

**Resistance Issues:**
- **Permethrin**: Widespread resistance (knockdown resistance - kdr mutations)
- **Ivermectin**: Emerging resistance during treatment (7.5% failures in recent studies)
- **Alternatives**: Dimethicone, isopropyl myristate (physically target lice; no biochemical resistance)

**Scabies (*Sarcoptes scabiei*):**

| Type | Treatment | Application | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **Conventional scabies** | **Permethrin 5% cream** | Apply neck-down, leave 8-12h (overnight), wash off; **repeat in 1 week** | FDA-approved; first-line |
| | **Oral ivermectin 200 µg/kg** | Single dose; **repeat in 1-2 weeks** | NOT FDA-approved for scabies (but WHO essential medicines list); **do NOT use if <15 kg or pregnant** |
| **Crusted (Norwegian) scabies** | **Combination therapy:**<br>- Permethrin 5% cream daily × 7 days (full-body)<br>- Oral ivermectin 200 µg/kg on **days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15** | Aggressive treatment required | Immunocompromised; thousands of mites; highly contagious |

**Crusted Scabies Key Points:**
- **High burden**: Thousands of mites (vs 10-15 in conventional scabies)
- **Risk factors**: Immunosuppression, corticosteroid use, institutionalized patients
- **Treatment**: Combination permethrin + ivermectin (up to 7 doses ivermectin may be needed)
- **Infection control**: Isolate patient; treat all contacts

**Permethrin Resistance (2024):**
- Clinical studies and in vitro investigations show **significant resistance** to permethrin
- Geographic distribution of resistant scabies not well-defined
- Consider ivermectin for treatment failures

**Key Points:**
- **Head lice**: Permethrin first-line (but resistance common); ivermectin alternative
- **Scabies**: Permethrin 5% cream (conventional) or oral ivermectin
- **Crusted scabies**: Combination therapy (permethrin daily + ivermectin multiple doses)
- **Resistance**: Both permethrin and ivermectin resistance emerging

**Mnemonic - "Lice = Lotion (permethrin), Scabies = Skin cream (permethrin 5%), Crusted = Combo (both)"**

**Pearl:** Permethrin resistance widespread in head lice (kdr mutations in 95% of European lice). Ivermectin (topical or oral) effective alternative, but emerging resistance (7.5% failures). Crusted scabies requires aggressive combination therapy: permethrin 5% daily + oral ivermectin multiple doses (days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15). 2024 review shows significant permethrin resistance in scabies.
