## Myiasis, Tungiasis, Mites (Chiggers), and Ticks

**Q:** What are the clinical features and treatments for myiasis, tungiasis, chigger bites, and tick-related diseases?

**A:**

**Myiasis (Botfly Larvae Infestation):**

| Type | Organism | Clinical Features | Treatment |
|------|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Furuncular myiasis** | *Dermatobia hominis* (human botfly - Latin America), *Cordylobia anthropophaga* (tumbu fly - Africa) | **Furuncle-like lesion** with central punctum; larvae move under skin; "sensation of movement" | **Surgical extraction** OR suffocation (petroleum jelly, liquid paraffin, bacon strips over punctum × 3-24h to coax larvae out) |
| **Wound/traumatic myiasis** | *Cochliomyia hominivorax* (screwworm), *Chrysomya* | Larvae in open wounds, necrotic tissue | Surgical debridement + irrigation; ivermectin adjunct |
| **Nasal myiasis** | Various flies | Nasal obstruction, epistaxis, foul odor | Extraction + nasal irrigation |

**Key Points:**
- Botflies feed for 5-10 weeks, then eject spontaneously (can resolve without treatment)
- Suffocation method: Apply occlusive substance over punctum to force larvae out
- Antibiotics if secondary infection; systemic ivermectin may help

**Tungiasis (*Tunga penetrans* - Sand Flea):**
- **Transmission**: Barefoot walking on sandy soil (tropical Africa, Central/South America)
- **Clinical**: **Painful nodule** (2-10 mm) with central black dot (flea's posterior); typically feet/toes
- **Treatment**: **Early surgical removal** (reduces infection risk); sand flea eventually shed spontaneously
- **Complications**: Secondary bacterial infection, tetanus

**Mites (Chiggers) and Trombiculosis:**

| Organism | Disease | Clinical Features | Treatment |
|----------|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Trombiculid mites** (chiggers) | **Trombiculosis** | **Intense pruritus** + papulovesicular rash (grouped/linear patterns); exposed skin or along tight-fitting clothes | **Supportive** (antihistamines, topical steroids); self-limited |
| ***Orientia tsutsugamushi*** (transmitted by chiggers) | **Scrub typhus** | Fever, headache, myalgia, **eschar at bite site**, rash; "tsutsugamushi triangle" (Asia-Pacific) | **Doxycycline 100 mg BID × 7-10 days** |
| **House dust mites** | Rickettsialpox (*Rickettsia akari*) | Vesicular rash, fever, eschar; transmitted by mites from rodents | Doxycycline |

**Key Points:**
- Chiggers: Larval mites; bite causes intense pruritus (trombiculosis)
- Scrub typhus: **Eschar** pathognomonic; doxycycline treatment of choice
- 2024: Rickettsia infections from chiggers reported in North Carolina (expanding range)

**Ticks and Tick Paralysis:**

| Tick Species | Associated Diseases | Geographic Distribution |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| ***Ixodes scapularis*** (black-legged tick) | Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, babesiosis, **tick paralysis** (rare) | Eastern/Central US |
| ***Dermacentor variabilis*** (American dog tick) | RMSF, tularemia, **tick paralysis** (most common) | US (east of Rockies) |
| ***Dermacentor andersoni*** (Rocky Mountain wood tick) | RMSF, Colorado tick fever, **tick paralysis** (most common) | Western US |
| ***Amblyomma americanum*** (Lone Star tick) | Ehrlichiosis, STARI, alpha-gal syndrome, **tick paralysis** (rare) | Southeastern/Central US |

**Tick Paralysis:**
- **Mechanism**: Salivary **neurotoxin** from engorged female tick during feeding
- **Clinical**: **Ascending flaccid paralysis** (mimics Guillain-Barré); starts in legs, progresses to respiratory muscles
- **Diagnosis**: Find attached tick (scalp, hairline)
- **Treatment**: **Tick removal** → rapid recovery (within hours for *Dermacentor*; may worsen 24-48h for Australian *Ixodes holocyclus*)
- **Prevention**: Protective clothing, permethrin on clothing, tick checks after outdoor activities

**Tick-Borne Disease Prevention (2024):**
- Long pants/sleeves, tuck pants into socks
- Permethrin on clothing (highly effective repellent)
- DEET/picaridin on exposed skin
- Daily tick checks (remove within 24h to prevent Lyme transmission)

**Key Points:**
- **Myiasis**: Botfly larvae; surgical extraction or suffocation technique
- **Tungiasis**: Sand flea; early surgical removal
- **Chiggers**: Trombiculosis (pruritus) or scrub typhus (eschar + fever)
- **Tick paralysis**: Ascending paralysis; cure is tick removal

**Mnemonic - "Tick Paralysis = Toxin from Tick, Treatment = Take it off"**

**Pearl:** Tick paralysis causes ascending flaccid paralysis from engorged female tick neurotoxin. Recovery within hours of tick removal (*Dermacentor* spp). Scrub typhus (chigger-borne) presents with eschar + fever; treat with doxycycline. Myiasis: suffocation technique (petroleum jelly over punctum × 3-24h) or surgical extraction.
