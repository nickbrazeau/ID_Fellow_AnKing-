## Coltiviruses (Colorado Tick Fever) and Seadornaviruses (Banna Virus)

**Q:** What are the clinical features and geographic distributions of Colorado tick fever virus and Banna virus?

**A:**

**Colorado Tick Fever Virus (CTFV) - Coltivirus:**

**Epidemiology:**
- **Endemic**: Rocky Mountain region (US/Canada)
- **Vector**: *Dermacentor andersoni* (wood tick)
- **Season**: Spring/summer (tick activity)

**Clinical Features:**

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Presentation** | Headache, fever, myalgia, arthralgia, **retro-orbital pain**, photophobia, neck stiffness |
| **Rash** | **Macular/maculopapular/petechial** (10% of cases) |
| **Fever pattern** | **Biphasic/triphasic** (50% of cases): 2-3 days fever → 2 days remission → 2-3 days fever (total 5-10 days) |
| **Complications** | **Meningitis** (not uncommon), encephalitis (rare), hemorrhagic fever (rare, mainly children); **<7% complication rate** |
| **Hospitalization** | ~20% |

**Laboratory Findings:**
- **Leukopenia** (65%): WBC 900-3,900/μL
- **Thrombocytopenia**: Platelets 20,000-95,000/μL
- **Viral persistence**: Virus in RBCs for **up to 4 months** (avoid blood donation)

**Diagnosis:**
- RT-PCR (CTFV RNA)
- Serology (IFA, ELISA, complement fixation)
- Viral culture (suckling mice)

**Treatment:** **Supportive care** (acetaminophen for fever/pain)

**Banna Virus (BAV) - Seadornavirus:**

**Epidemiology:**
- **Endemic**: **Southeast Asia** (China, Indonesia)
- **Vector**: Mosquitoes
- **Clinical disease**: **Sporadic encephalitis cases**

**Clinical Features:**
- Flu-like symptoms, myalgia, arthralgia, fever
- **Encephalitis** (BAV implicated as cause in China)
- May be **misdiagnosed as Japanese encephalitis** (co-endemic)

**Treatment:** **Supportive care**

**Pearl:** Colorado tick fever has biphasic fever (50% of cases) and causes prolonged viremia (up to 4 months in RBCs). Banna virus encephalitis may be underreported due to overlap with JE-endemic regions.

**Mnemonic - "Colorado's Double Fever"**: Biphasic fever pattern, Double hit to blood counts (leukopenia + thrombocytopenia)
