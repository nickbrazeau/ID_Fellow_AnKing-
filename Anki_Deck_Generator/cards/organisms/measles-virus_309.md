## Measles Virus (Rubeola)

**Q:** What are the pathognomonic features and major complications of measles, and what is the MMR vaccine efficacy?

**A:**

**Clinical Phases:**

**1. Prodrome (2-4 days before rash):**
- **"Three Cs"**: **C**ough, **C**oryza (rhinorrhea), **C**onjunctivitis
- High fever (up to 105°F/40.6°C)
- **Koplik spots** (PATHOGNOMONIC): 1-2 mm **blue-white lesions** on erythematous buccal mucosa (near **second molars**); appear **2-3 days after symptom onset**

**2. Exanthem (rash phase):**
- **Erythematous maculopapular rash**: Starts **face** → spreads downward (head to trunk to extremities)
- Lasts **5-6 days**, then desquamates

**Complications:**

| Complication | Incidence | Features |
|--------------|-----------|----------|
| **Pneumonia** | Most common cause of death | Viral or secondary bacterial |
| **Acute encephalitis** | **1 in 1,000 cases** | Often causes **permanent neurologic deficits** |
| **Otitis media** | Common | Middle ear infection |
| **Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE)** | **1 in 10,000** | **Fatal** CNS disease; develops **7-10 years** after acute infection; progressive neurologic deterioration |

**High-Risk Groups for Complications:**
- Young children (<5 years)
- Adults (>20 years)
- Immunocompromised individuals
- Pregnant women

**MMR Vaccine:**

| Dose | Timing | Efficacy |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Dose 1** | 12-15 months | **93% effective** |
| **Dose 2** | 4-6 years | **97% effective** |

**Transmission:**
- **Highly contagious** (airborne, droplet)
- **R0 ~12-18** (among highest of infectious diseases)

**Recent Epidemiology (US):**
- 285 cases (2024), 1,024 cases (as of May 2025) - rising due to vaccination gaps

**Key Points:**
- **Koplik spots**: Pathognomonic (blue-white buccal lesions near molars)
- **"Three Cs"**: Cough, coryza, conjunctivitis (prodrome)
- **SSPE**: Rare (1/10,000) but fatal late complication (7-10 years later)
- **Encephalitis**: 1/1,000 cases, often permanent deficits

**Mnemonic - "3 C's + K = Measles"**: Cough, Coryza, Conjunctivitis + Koplik spots

**Pearl:** Koplik spots (blue-white buccal lesions) are pathognomonic for measles and appear before the rash. SSPE is a rare but invariably fatal late complication occurring 7-10 years after acute infection.
