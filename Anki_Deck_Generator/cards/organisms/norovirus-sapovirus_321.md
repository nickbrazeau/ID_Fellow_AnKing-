## Norovirus and Sapoviruses

**Q:** What are the epidemiologic features, transmission, and clinical characteristics of norovirus gastroenteritis?

**A:**

**Overview:**
- **Caliciviridae family**
- **Norovirus** (Norwalk virus): **Most common cause of gastroenteritis worldwide**
- **Sapovirus**: Less common, similar presentation

**Norovirus Epidemiology:**

**Burden:**
- **Leading cause of foodborne illness** in US (**58%** of foodborne infections)
- **Leading cause of gastroenteritis outbreaks** (cruise ships, nursing homes, schools, military)
- "Winter vomiting disease" (peak in **cold/dry weather**)

**2024 Outbreak Data:**
- **495 outbreaks** (August-December 2024) vs 363 in same period 2023 (**36% increase**)
- **Cruise ships**: 16 GI outbreaks in 2024 (CDC); >90% due to norovirus
- Cruise ship outbreaks = **<1% of total** norovirus outbreaks (but highly visible)

**Transmission:**

| Route | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Fecal-oral** | Contaminated food/water (esp. shellfish) |
| **Person-to-person** | **Highly contagious** (low infectious dose: <100 virions) |
| **Fomites** | Contaminated surfaces |
| **Vomitus** | Aerosolized virus from vomiting |

**Clinical Features:**

**Incubation:** **12-48 hours**

**Presentation:**
- **Sudden onset** nausea, **vomiting** (prominent)
- **Watery diarrhea** (non-bloody)
- Abdominal cramps, low-grade fever, myalgia
- **Duration**: **24-72 hours** (self-limited)

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Vomiting > diarrhea** (distinguishes from bacterial gastroenteritis)
- **Attack rate**: 50-70% in outbreaks (highly contagious)

**Diagnosis:**
- **RT-PCR** (stool)
- Clinical diagnosis in outbreak settings

**Treatment:**
- **Supportive care**: Oral/IV hydration
- **NO specific antiviral**

**Prevention:**

| Measure | Effectiveness |
|---------|---------------|
| **Hand washing** (soap + water ≥20 sec) | **Most effective** (alcohol-based sanitizers less effective against norovirus) |
| **Surface disinfection** | Bleach-based cleaners (norovirus resistant to many disinfectants) |
| **Isolation** | Exclude ill food workers/caregivers for ≥48 hours after symptom resolution |

**Sapovirus:**
- **Less common** than norovirus
- Similar clinical presentation (gastroenteritis)
- Detected less frequently in outbreaks

**Key Points:**
- **Most common cause of gastroenteritis** worldwide
- **Highly contagious** (low infectious dose, spreads rapidly in closed settings)
- **Vomiting prominent** (> diarrhea)
- **Self-limited** (24-72 hours)
- **Hand washing with soap/water** most effective prevention (alcohol sanitizers insufficient)

**Mnemonic - "Norwalk = NO Water, ALcohol Kills (poorly)"**: Norovirus resistant to alcohol sanitizers; need soap + water

**Pearl:** Norovirus is the leading cause of foodborne illness (58% US cases) and gastroenteritis outbreaks. Highly contagious (low infectious dose <100 virions). Alcohol sanitizers are insufficient—hand washing with soap and water for ≥20 seconds is critical.
