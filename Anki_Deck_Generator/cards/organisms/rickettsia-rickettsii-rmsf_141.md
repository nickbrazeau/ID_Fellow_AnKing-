## Question

How is RMSF diagnosed and treated? Use the **"Start Doxycycline Empirically (Don't Wait), Triad = Fever + Headache + Rash"** framework.

## Answer

### ***Rickettsia rickettsii* (RMSF) Overview:**

**Transmission:**
- ***Dermacentor* ticks:** Dog tick (D. variabilis), wood tick (D. andersoni)
- **Geographic:** Southeast, South-Central US (Arkansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Tennessee, North Carolina)
- **Seasonality:** Spring-summer (April-September)

**Pathophysiology:**
- **Obligate intracellular bacterium**
- **Infects vascular endothelium** → vasculitis → vascular leak, thrombosis

### **Clinical Presentation:**

**Classic Triad (Only 60% Have All Three):**
- **Fever** (nearly 100%)
- **Headache** (severe, 90%)
- **Rash** (90% eventually, but only **60% in first 3 days**)

**Rash:**
- **Timing:** Appears **day 3-5** (often ABSENT early)
- **Distribution:** **Wrists/ankles first** → **centripetal spread** (trunk)
- **Morphology:** **Maculopapular → petechial/purpuric** (as disease progresses)
- **Palms/soles:** Involved in 50-80% (classic but not always present)
- **10% never develop rash** (more common in dark-skinned individuals, elderly)

**Other Symptoms:**
- **GI:** Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain (common, can mimic acute abdomen)
- **Neurologic:** Confusion, altered mental status, focal deficits, seizures
- **Respiratory:** Cough, dyspnea, ARDS

**Severe Complications:**
- **Multi-organ failure**
- **ARDS**
- **Meningitis/encephalitis**
- **Acute kidney injury**
- **DIC**
- **Gangrene** (requiring amputation)

### **Diagnosis:**

**Clinical Diagnosis:**
- **HIGH INDEX OF SUSPICION** critical (do NOT wait for confirmatory testing)
- **Start doxycycline empirically** if compatible clinical picture + tick exposure

**Laboratory:**

| Test | Timing | Sensitivity | Notes |
|------|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Serology (IFA):** IgG/IgM | **Acute + convalescent** (4-fold rise) | **Gold standard** (>95%) | **Negative in first week** (not useful early), 4-fold rise diagnostic |
| **PCR** | Acute | 60-70% (early) | Whole blood or skin biopsy, **low sensitivity** |
| **Skin biopsy (immunohistochemistry)** | Acute (if rash present) | 70% | Detects *Rickettsia* in endothelium, rarely done |

**Non-Specific Labs (Supportive):**
- **Thrombocytopenia** (50-60%)
- **Hyponatremia** (55%)
- **Transaminitis** (elevated LFTs)
- **Anemia** (late)

**Key Point:** **Serology negative early** (first 7-10 days) → **do NOT rule out RMSF**

### **Treatment:**

**First-Line (All Ages):**
- **Doxycycline 100mg PO/IV BID** (adults)
- **Doxycycline 2.2 mg/kg/dose PO/IV BID** (children <45kg, max 100mg/dose)
- **Start empirically** if suspected (do NOT wait for confirmation)

**Duration:**
- **Continue for ≥3 days after fever resolves** AND **minimum 5-7 days total**
- Typically 7-10 days

**Alternative (if true contraindication to doxycycline):**
- **Chloramphenicol** (NOT available in US, used internationally)
- **No acceptable alternatives** in US → doxycycline is only option

**Key:** **Doxycycline safe in children** for RMSF (short course, benefits >> risks of dental staining)

### **Prognosis:**

**Mortality:**
- **Untreated:** 20-30%
- **Treated early (<5 days):** <5%
- **Delayed treatment (>5 days):** 20-30%

**Risk Factors for Severe Disease/Death:**
- **Delayed treatment** (>5 days of symptoms)
- **Age >40 years**
- **G6PD deficiency**
- **Chronic illness**, **immunosuppression**

## Key Points

### **Clinical Pitfalls:**
- **Rash often ABSENT early** (only 60% in first 3 days) → **do NOT wait for rash**
- **Serology negative early** → **do NOT wait for confirmatory testing**
- **Only 60% have classic triad** early in disease
- **GI symptoms common** (can mimic acute abdomen)

### **Empiric Treatment Threshold:**
- **Fever + headache + tick exposure** (endemic area, summer) = **start doxycycline**
- **Better to overtreat** than delay (high mortality if delayed)

### **Doxycycline in Children:**
- **Safe for RMSF** (short course <3 weeks)
- **Dental staining negligible** with short courses
- **AAP/CDC recommend** doxycycline for all ages with suspected RMSF
- **Do NOT use chloramphenicol** (not available, inferior outcomes)

### **Other Spotted Fever Group Rickettsiae:**
- ***R. parkeri*:** Milder than RMSF, **eschar** at bite site (unlike RMSF)
- ***R. akari*:** Rickettsialpox (mild, vesicular rash, eschar)
- ***R. prowazekii*:** Epidemic typhus (louse-borne)

### **Prevention:**
- **Tick avoidance:** Protective clothing, DEET, permethrin on clothing
- **Tick removal:** Within 24 hours (reduces transmission risk)
- **No prophylactic doxycycline** after tick bite (not recommended)

### **Clinical Pearls:**
- **Start doxycycline empirically** if fever + headache + tick exposure (do NOT wait for rash or testing)
- **Rash appears day 3-5** (wrists/ankles → centripetal), often ABSENT early
- **Serology negative first week** (not useful early)
- **High mortality if delayed** (>5 days before treatment)
- **Doxycycline safe in children** for RMSF (AAP/CDC recommended)
- **Thrombocytopenia + hyponatremia** = supportive labs
