## Mumps Virus

**Q:** What are the major complications of mumps, their frequencies, and the protective effect of MMR vaccine?

**A:**

**Clinical Presentation:**
- **Prodrome**: Headache, fever, fatigue, anorexia, malaise (1-2 days)
- **Hallmark**: **Bilateral parotitis** (parotid swelling/tenderness)

**Complications (Unvaccinated Patients):**

| Complication | Frequency | Clinical Features |
|--------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Orchitis** | **20-50% post-pubertal males** | Unilateral/bilateral testicular swelling, pain; **testicular atrophy in 50%**; infertility/subfertility in **up to 30%** (rare in pre-pubertal boys) |
| **Aseptic meningitis** | **Up to 10%** | CSF pleocytosis; mumps was leading cause of aseptic meningitis in US pre-vaccine era |
| **Pancreatitis** | **Up to 4%** | Abdominal pain, elevated lipase/amylase |
| **Sensorineural hearing loss** | **Up to 4%** | Usually unilateral, permanent |
| **Oophoritis** | **5%** of post-pubertal females | Ovarian inflammation; fertility rarely affected |
| **Encephalitis** | **<1%** | Rare but serious |

**MMR Vaccine Protection:**

**Efficacy:**
- **2 doses MMR**: Substantial protection against mumps
- Vaccinated individuals with breakthrough infection have **lower rates of complications**:
  - Less orchitis, deafness, meningitis, oophoritis than unvaccinated/1-dose recipients

**Recent Outbreaks:**
- Despite high vaccination rates, outbreaks occur in **fully vaccinated populations** (waning immunity, vaccine mismatch)
- 2018-2023: 8,006 US mumps cases reported (85% occurred before COVID-19 pandemic measures)

**Vaccine-Related Cases (Rare):**
- Parotitis, aseptic meningitis, orchitis can occur **18-28 days post-MMR** (vaccine-strain virus)
- Very rare

**Key Points:**
- **Orchitis**: Most feared complication (20-50% post-pubertal males); can cause infertility (30%)
- **Aseptic meningitis**: Common (10% unvaccinated)
- **MMR reduces complications** even when breakthrough infection occurs
- Outbreaks still occur in vaccinated populations

**Mnemonic - "HOPES" complications**:
- **H**earing loss (4%)
- **O**rchitis (20-50% post-pubertal males)
- **P**ancreatitis (4%)
- **E**ncephalitis (<1%)
- **S**eptic (aseptic) meningitis (10%)

**Pearl:** Mumps orchitis occurs in 20-50% of post-pubertal males and causes testicular atrophy in 50% of those affected, with infertility risk up to 30%. MMR vaccine reduces complication rates even in breakthrough infections.
