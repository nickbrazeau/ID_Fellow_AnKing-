## Rickettsiae, Ehrlichia, and Anaplasma (Tick-Borne)

**Q:** What are the major tick-borne rickettsial diseases and their unified treatment approach?

**A:**

**Major Tick-Borne Rickettsial Diseases:**

| Disease | Organism | Vector | Rash | Key Features |
|---------|----------|--------|------|--------------|
| **Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF)** | *Rickettsia rickettsii* | *Dermacentor* ticks (dog, wood) | **Petechial rash** (palms/soles); starts day 3-5 | **Most severe**; 20-30% mortality untreated |
| **Epidemic Typhus** | *R. prowazekii* | Body lice | Maculopapular rash (trunk → extremities) | Louse-borne; **Brill-Zinsser** (relapse years later) |
| **Murine Typhus** | *R. typhi* | Flea (rat) | Maculopapular rash | Milder than RMSF |
| **Scrub Typhus** | *Orientia tsutsugamushi* | Chigger mites | Maculopapular; **eschar** at bite site | Asia-Pacific; eschar pathognomonic |
| **Ehrlichiosis** (HME) | *Ehrlichia chaffeensis* | *Amblyomma americanum* (Lone Star tick) | Rash **uncommon** (30%) | **Monocytes** infected; **mulberry cells** (morulae) |
| **Anaplasmosis** (HGA) | *Anaplasma phagocytophilum* | *Ixodes scapularis* (same as Lyme) | Rash **rare** (<10%) | **Granulocytes** infected; morulae; **Lyme coinfection** possible |

**Unified Clinical Features:**
- Fever, headache, myalgia
- **Thrombocytopenia, transaminitis, leukopenia** (common in all)
- Severe disease: **DIC, ARDS, meningoencephalitis**, multiorgan failure

**Treatment - SAME FOR ALL:**

**Doxycycline 100 mg PO/IV BID** (2.2 mg/kg BID for children <45 kg)

**Duration:**
- **RMSF/Ehrlichiosis**: 5-7 days minimum (**at least 3 days after fever resolves**)
- **Anaplasmosis**: **10 days** (to cover possible coinfection)

**Key Principles:**
- **Start empirically** if suspected (don't wait for confirmation)
- **Most effective if started within 5 days** of symptom onset
- **Safe in children and pregnancy** (short course; no tooth staining)
- **NO alternatives** equally effective (chloramphenicol second-line but inferior)

**Diagnostic Clues:**

| Disease | Specific Clue |
|---------|---------------|
| **RMSF** | Petechial rash **including palms/soles** (classic but late finding) |
| **Scrub Typhus** | **Eschar** (necrotic ulcer at bite site) |
| **Ehrlichiosis** | **Morulae in monocytes** (mulberry-like inclusions); rash uncommon |
| **Anaplasmosis** | **Morulae in granulocytes**; Lyme coinfection; rash rare |

**Laboratory:**
- **Thrombocytopenia + transaminitis + leukopenia** = classic triad
- Serology (retrospective diagnosis; IgM/IgG)
- PCR (acute phase)

**Key Points:**
- **Doxycycline** is treatment for ALL tick-borne rickettsial diseases
- **Start empirically** (don't wait for lab confirmation)
- **RMSF most severe** (20-30% mortality untreated)
- **Ehrlichiosis/Anaplasmosis**: Morulae in WBCs; rash uncommon
- **Safe in children/pregnancy** (short doxycycline course)

**Mnemonic - "Doxy for ALL Ticks"**: Doxycycline treats all tick-borne rickettsial diseases

**Pearl:** ALL tick-borne rickettsial diseases are treated with doxycycline 100 mg BID (safe in children and pregnancy for short courses). Start empirically if suspected—most effective within 5 days of symptom onset. RMSF has 20-30% mortality if untreated.
