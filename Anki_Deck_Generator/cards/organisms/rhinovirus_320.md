## Rhinovirus

**Q:** What are the clinical manifestations and complications of rhinovirus infection?

**A:**

**Overview:**
- **Picornaviridae family**
- **>100 serotypes** (A, B, C species)
- **Most common cause of common cold** (30-50% of cases)
- **Year-round circulation**; peaks in **spring and fall**

**Transmission:**
- **Respiratory droplets**, direct contact, fomites
- **Incubation**: 12-72 hours

**Clinical Manifestations:**

**Typical "Common Cold":**
- **Rhinorrhea** (clear nasal discharge)
- **Nasal congestion**
- Sneezing, sore throat, cough
- Mild fever (rare in adults, more common in children)
- **Self-limited** (7-10 days)

**Complications:**

| Complication | Details |
|--------------|---------|
| **Asthma exacerbation** | **Most common viral trigger** of asthma attacks; wheezing, dyspnea |
| **COPD exacerbation** | Triggers acute exacerbations in COPD patients |
| **Sinusitis** | Secondary bacterial sinusitis (uncommon) |
| **Otitis media** | Secondary bacterial infection in children |
| **Lower respiratory tract infection** | Bronchiolitis, pneumonia (immunocompromised, elderly, infants) |

**Key Points:**
- **Most common cause of common cold** (30-50%)
- **Leading viral trigger** of asthma exacerbations
- Usually mild, self-limited (7-10 days)
- **NO specific antiviral treatment** (supportive care only)
- **>100 serotypes** → vaccine impractical

**Treatment:**
- **Supportive care**: Hydration, rest, NSAIDs/acetaminophen for symptoms
- **Decongestants, antihistamines** (limited benefit)
- **NO antibiotics** (viral infection)

**Pearl:** Rhinovirus is the most common cause of the common cold and the leading viral trigger of asthma exacerbations. With >100 serotypes, vaccine development is impractical. Treatment is purely supportive.
