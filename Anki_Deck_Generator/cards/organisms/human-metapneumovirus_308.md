## Human Metapneumovirus (hMPV)

**Q:** What are the clinical features, seasonality, and management of hMPV infection, and how does it compare to RSV?

**A:**

**Overview:**
- **Paramyxovirus**, first identified **2001**
- Major cause of respiratory infections in children (similar clinical spectrum to RSV)

**Clinical Manifestations:**

| Severity | Features |
|----------|----------|
| **Mild (URTI)** | Cough, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea |
| **Severe (LRTI)** | **Bronchiolitis, pneumonia**, fever, dyspnea, wheezing, cyanosis, subcostal retractions |

**Epidemiology:**

**Children:**
- **3-10% of hospitalizations** for acute respiratory infections in children <5 years
- **~10% of pediatric bronchiolitis/pneumonia hospitalizations**
- **Older infants/children** more commonly affected than RSV (RSV affects younger infants)

**hMPV vs RSV in Hospitalized Children:**

| Feature | hMPV | RSV |
|---------|------|-----|
| **Age affected** | **Older children** | **Very young infants** |
| **Bronchiolitis** | Less frequent | **More frequent** |
| **Pneumonia** | **More frequent** | Less frequent |
| **High-flow O2 support** | Less common | **More common** |
| **Mechanical ventilation** | **More common** | Less common |

**Seasonality:**

**Pre-COVID-19:**
- **Winter through spring** (peaks late March in US)
- Northern Hemisphere: January-March
- Southern Hemisphere: June-July
- Median season duration: **21 weeks**

**Post-COVID-19:**
- Offseason cases, loss of alternating pattern
- 2024: Increased cases in December (China: 6.2% positive tests)

**Diagnosis:**
- **RT-PCR** (preferred; difficult to culture)
- Rapid antigen tests available
- Clinical diagnosis for most cases

**Treatment:**
- **NO specific antiviral or vaccine**
- **Supportive care**:
  - Hydration
  - Oxygen therapy
  - High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) or CPAP for respiratory distress
  - Mechanical ventilation if severe

**Key Points:**
- hMPV causes ~10% of pediatric bronchiolitis/pneumonia hospitalizations
- Affects **older children** compared to RSV (which affects younger infants)
- **More pneumonia** with hMPV; **more bronchiolitis** with RSV
- Peaks **winter-spring** (similar to RSV but slightly later)

**Pearl:** hMPV often requires mechanical ventilation more than RSV despite less bronchiolitis. Clinically indistinguishable from RSV—diagnosis requires testing.
