## Astroviruses, Picobirnaviruses, and Hepatitis E Virus

**Q:** What are the clinical features of astrovirus/picobirnavirus gastroenteritis and hepatitis E, including zoonotic transmission and pregnancy risks?

**A:**

**Astrovirus:**
- **Calicivirus-like virus** (small round RNA virus)
- Causes **mild gastroenteritis** in children and immunocompromised
- **Watery diarrhea**, vomiting, fever (self-limited)
- Less common than rotavirus/norovirus

**Picobirnavirus (PBV):**
- **Bisegmented dsRNA virus**
- Detected in **diarrheal stool** (both humans and animals)
- **Pathogenicity uncertain** (may be commensal or opportunistic)
- Found in **15% of diarrheal pig samples**

**Hepatitis E Virus (HEV):**

**Overview:**
- **Hepeviridae family** (single-stranded RNA)
- **8 genotypes**:
  - **Genotypes 1 & 2**: Human-only, fecal-oral (contaminated water), endemic in developing countries
  - **Genotypes 3 & 4**: **Zoonotic** (pigs, wild boar, rabbits, deer), undercooked pork/game meat

**Epidemiology:**

**Zoonotic Transmission (Genotypes 3 & 4):**
- **Pigs = main reservoir** worldwide
- **Undercooked pork** primary source (liver, sausage)
- **2024 Finland outbreak**: 120 cases from pork products (42 hospitalized)

**Global Burden (Endemic Regions - Genotypes 1 & 2):**
- **20 million infections/year**, 3.4 million symptomatic, **70,000 deaths**, 3,000 stillbirths

**Clinical Features:**

| Population | Mortality | Features |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| **General population** | **1-4%** | Acute hepatitis (jaundice, fever, abdominal pain); usually self-limited |
| **Pregnant women** | **20-25%** (endemic regions) | **Fulminant hepatitis** (especially 3rd trimester); **1,000 maternal deaths/year in India** |
| **Chronic liver disease patients** | Increased risk | Acute-on-chronic liver failure |
| **Immunocompromised** | **Chronic HEV** possible (transplant recipients) | Persistent infection, cirrhosis |

**Key Points (HEV):**
- **Genotypes 3 & 4**: Zoonotic (pigs/pork), developed countries
- **Pregnancy = HIGH MORTALITY** (20-25% in endemic regions, especially 3rd trimester)
- **NO chronic infection** in immunocompetent (unlike HBV/HCV)
- **Chronic HEV** can occur in immunocompromised

**Diagnosis:**
- **Anti-HEV IgM** (acute infection)
- **HEV RNA PCR**

**Treatment:**
- **Supportive care** (most cases)
- **Ribavirin** (chronic HEV in immunocompromised)

**Prevention:**
- Cook pork/game meat thoroughly
- Safe water (endemic regions)
- **Vaccine** available in China (not widely available elsewhere)

**Pearl:** Hepatitis E has 20-25% mortality in pregnant women (endemic regions), especially 3rd trimester. Genotypes 3 & 4 are zoonotic (pigs/undercooked pork). 2024 Finland outbreak (120 cases) linked to pork products.
