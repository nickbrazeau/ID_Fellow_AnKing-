## Question

How is rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) administered? Use the **"HRIG + Vaccine (Days 0, 3, 7, 14) if Not Pre-Vaccinated"** framework.

## Answer

### **Rabies Virus Overview:**

**Transmission:**
- **Animal bite** (saliva)
- **High-risk animals in US:** **Bats**, raccoons, skunks, foxes, coyotes
- **Low-risk:** Dogs/cats (if vaccinated), rodents (very rare)
- **Global:** Dogs (99% of human rabies worldwide)

**Pathophysiology:**
- **Neurotropic virus** → travels via peripheral nerves to CNS
- **Incubation:** Weeks to months (depends on bite location - closer to brain = shorter)
- **Once symptomatic:** **Nearly 100% fatal**

### **Clinical Presentation (Rabies Encephalitis):**

**Prodrome (2-10 days):**
- Fever, headache, malaise
- **Paresthesias at bite site** (50%)

**Acute Neurologic Phase:**

**Furious Rabies (80%):**
- **Hydrophobia** (pharyngeal spasm triggered by water/liquids)
- **Aerophobia** (spasm triggered by air/breeze)
- **Hyperactivity**, agitation, hallucinations
- **Autonomic instability**
- **Fluctuating consciousness**

**Paralytic Rabies (20%):**
- **Ascending paralysis** (mimics Guillain-Barré)
- Less autonomic instability

**Coma and Death:**
- Progression to coma, cardiorespiratory failure
- **Death within 7-14 days** of symptom onset

**Diagnosis (if symptomatic):**
- **Skin biopsy (nuchal):** Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) - detects virus in hair follicle nerves
- **Saliva:** RT-PCR, viral culture
- **CSF:** Antibodies (if no prior vaccination)
- **Serum:** Antibodies
- **Brain biopsy** (postmortem): Negri bodies (eosinophilic inclusions in neurons)

### **Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP):**

**Indications for PEP:**
- **Bite from rabies-vector species** (bat, raccoon, skunk, fox, wild carnivore)
- **Bat exposure WITHOUT clear bite** (bat in room with sleeping person, unattended child, intoxicated person)
- **Bite from unknown/escaped animal**
- **Dog/cat bite** (if animal unavailable for 10-day observation OR shows signs of rabies)

**Do NOT Give PEP:**
- **Bite from animal available for observation** (healthy dog/cat) - observe × 10 days
- **Rodent bite** (very low risk, unless unusual circumstances)
- **Vaccinated dog/cat** (low risk, observe animal)

### **PEP Regimen:**

**Previously Unvaccinated:**
- **Human Rabies Immune Globulin (HRIG):** **20 IU/kg** (infiltrate around wound as much as possible + remainder IM distant from vaccine site)
- **+**
- **Rabies Vaccine (RabAvert or Imovax):** **Days 0, 3, 7, 14** (4 doses, deltoid)
  - Note: 5th dose (day 28) no longer recommended for immunocompetent (2021 guideline change)

**Previously Vaccinated (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis):**
- **Rabies Vaccine ONLY:** **Days 0, 3** (2 doses, deltoid)
- **NO HRIG** (anamnestic response sufficient)

**Immunocompromised:**
- **HRIG** + **Vaccine days 0, 3, 7, 14, 28** (5 doses)
- **Check rabies antibody titer** at day 14-28 (ensure adequate response)

### **Wound Management:**
- **Immediate wound cleansing** (soap + water × 15 minutes) - **reduces risk by 90%**
- **Avoid suturing** (if possible) - allows drainage
- **Tetanus prophylaxis** (if indicated)
- **Antibiotics** (if indicated for bacterial infection)

## Key Points

### **Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis:**

**Indications:**
- **High-risk occupations:** Veterinarians, animal control, wildlife biologists, rabies lab workers
- **Travelers:** Prolonged stay in rabies-endemic areas with limited access to PEP

**Regimen:**
- **Rabies vaccine:** **Days 0, 7, 21 or 28** (3 doses, deltoid)
- **Booster titers** for high-risk (every 6 months to 2 years, depending on risk)

### **Bat Exposure (Special Considerations):**
- **Bat bites may not be apparent** (teeth very small)
- **Give PEP if:** Bat found in room with sleeping person, unattended child, impaired person (cannot reliably exclude bite)
- **Bats = #1 source of human rabies in US** (most people do not recall bite)

### **Animal Observation (10-Day Rule):**
- **Healthy dog/cat:** Observe × 10 days (if develops signs of rabies → start PEP)
- **If animal remains healthy × 10 days:** No PEP needed (not rabid at time of bite)
- **Wild animals:** Cannot be observed → give PEP

### **Rabies Immune Globulin (HRIG):**
- **Provides immediate passive immunity** (while vaccine induces active immunity)
- **Infiltrate around wound** (as much as anatomically feasible)
- **Remainder given IM** (distant from vaccine site - avoid interference)
- **Expensive, limited supply** (equine RIG alternative in some countries)

### **Treatment of Symptomatic Rabies:**
- **No effective treatment** once symptomatic
- **"Milwaukee Protocol"** (induced coma, antiviral therapy) - extremely rare survivors, severe neurologic sequelae, **not recommended** (experimental, poor outcomes)
- **Palliative care** standard

### **Clinical Pearls:**
- **PEP if bat exposure** (even without clear bite)
- **HRIG + vaccine (days 0, 3, 7, 14)** if not previously vaccinated
- **Vaccine ONLY (days 0, 3)** if previously vaccinated (NO HRIG)
- **Immediate wound cleansing** (soap + water × 15 min) reduces risk 90%
- **Hydrophobia + aerophobia** = classic signs (but nearly 100% fatal once symptomatic)
- **Observe healthy dog/cat × 10 days** (if remains healthy → no PEP needed)
- **Nearly 100% preventable with PEP**, nearly 100% fatal without
