## Human Papillomaviruses (HPV)

**Q:** What are the high-risk vs low-risk HPV types, vaccine coverage, and treatment options for anogenital warts?

**A:**

**HPV Types and Associated Diseases:**

| Risk Category | HPV Types | Associated Diseases |
|---------------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Low-risk** | **6, 11** | **90% of anogenital warts**, recurrent respiratory papillomatosis |
| **High-risk (oncogenic)** | **16, 18** (most common) + 31, 33, 45, 52, 58 | **70% of cervical cancer** (HPV 16/18); also vulvar, vaginal, anal, penile, oropharyngeal cancers |

**Vaccines:**

**Gardasil 9 (nonavalent)** - *only HPV vaccine available in US since 2017*:
- **Coverage**: HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, 58
- **Indications**: Prevention of cancer/precancer/warts (NOT treatment of existing disease)
- **Schedule**:
  - **Ages 11-12** (routine); can start age 9
  - **2-dose regimen** (0, 6-12 months) if initiated before age 15
  - **3-dose regimen** for immunocompromised or initiated ≥age 15
  - **Catch-up through age 26**
  - **Ages 27-45**: shared decision-making

**Treatment of Anogenital Warts:**

**Patient-Applied (No treatment for subclinical HPV infection):**

| Agent | Dosing | Duration | Pregnancy |
|-------|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Podofilox 0.5%** | Apply BID × 3 days, then 4 days off (cycle up to 4×) | Max 4 cycles | **Contraindicated** |
| **Imiquimod 5%** | Apply 3×/week at bedtime | Max 16 weeks | Avoid |
| **Sinecatechins 15%** | Apply TID | Max 16 weeks | Avoid |

**Provider-Administered:**
- **Cryotherapy** (liquid nitrogen)
- **Podophyllin resin** (wash off in 1-4 hours)
- **TCA/BCA** (trichloroacetic/bichloroacetic acid)
- **Surgical removal** (excision, electrocautery, laser)

**Key Principles:**
- **Subclinical HPV infection** → NO treatment (clears spontaneously)
- **Cervical dysplasia** → Follow cervical cancer screening guidelines
- Vaccine is **prophylactic**, not therapeutic

**Pearl:** HPV 16/18 cause 70% of cervical cancer; vaccine has dramatically reduced incidence. Treat only visible warts—subclinical infection clears spontaneously.
