## Vibrio vulnificus: Necrotizing Fasciitis & Primary Septicemia

**Q:** What are the risk factors, clinical syndromes, and treatment for Vibrio vulnificus infection?

**A:**

**Microbiology:**
- **Gram-negative, curved rod** (halophilic - requires salt)
- Natural habitat: Warm seawater (>20°C), brackish estuaries
- **Leading cause of seafood-related death in the US**

**Epidemiology:**
- Gulf Coast states (Texas, Louisiana, Florida)
- Warm months (May-October)
- Climate change → expanding geographic range (CDC HAN 2023)

---

**Risk Factors for Severe Disease:**

**"The 5 L's of V. vulnificus":**
1. **Liver disease** (cirrhosis, hepatitis) - #1 risk factor
2. **Low immunity** (HIV, malignancy, immunosuppressants)
3. **Liquor** (chronic alcoholism)
4. **Leukemia/lymphoma**
5. **Loaded iron** (hemochromatosis, thalassemia)

**Additional Risk Factors:**
- Diabetes
- Chronic kidney disease
- Age >40 years

**Case-Fatality Rates:**
- **Primary septicemia:** >50% mortality
- **Wound infection:** ~15% mortality
- **Overall:** ~30% mortality (even with treatment)

---

**Clinical Syndromes:**

**1. Primary Septicemia (Most Deadly):**

**Source:** Ingestion of raw/undercooked seafood (**raw oysters** most common)

**Presentation (Rapid Onset, 12-24h):**
- **Fever, chills, hypotension** (septic shock)
- **Bullous skin lesions** (hemorrhagic bullae) → ecchymoses → necrosis
- Often on **lower extremities**
- Gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) may precede
- Rapidly progressive → multi-organ failure

**Mortality:** >50% despite treatment

**2. Wound Infection/Necrotizing Fasciitis:**

**Source:** Seawater exposure through wound (cut, abrasion, puncture)

**Presentation (24-48h):**
- **Rapidly progressive cellulitis** → necrotizing fasciitis
- **Pain out of proportion to exam** (early sign)
- Erythema, swelling, bullae, hemorrhagic bullae
- Crepitus (gas in tissues)
- Myonecrosis
- Can progress to septic shock

**Mortality:** ~15%

**3. Gastroenteritis (Healthy Hosts):**
- Self-limited watery diarrhea
- Mild, resolves spontaneously
- Rare in immunocompetent

---

**Diagnosis:**

**Clinical Suspicion:**
- **Triad:** Liver disease + raw oysters + bullous skin lesions = V. vulnificus until proven otherwise

**Laboratory:**
- **Blood cultures:** Gram-negative curved rods
- **Wound cultures:** From bullae or necrotic tissue
- TCBS agar (green colonies - does not ferment sucrose, unlike V. cholerae)

**Imaging:**
- CT or MRI: Gas in soft tissues, fascial involvement

---

**Treatment (IMMEDIATE, DO NOT DELAY):**

**"Time is Tissue" - Early Treatment Critical:**
- Surgical debridement within **12 hours of admission** → ↓ mortality
- **DO NOT wait for lab confirmation or ID consult**

**1. Antibiotics (Start IMMEDIATELY):**

**Empiric Regimen (CDC-Recommended):**

| **First-Line** | **Dosing** |
|----------------|------------|
| **Doxycycline** | 100 mg IV/PO BID |
| PLUS | |
| **Ceftazidime** | 1-2g IV q8h |
| OR | |
| **Cefotaxime** | 2g IV q8h |
| OR | |
| **Ceftriaxone** | 2g IV q12-24h |

**Alternative Combinations:**
- Doxycycline + ciprofloxacin (if beta-lactam allergy)

**Duration:** 7-14 days (until clinical improvement)

**Key Point:**
- **Doxycycline + 3rd-generation cephalosporin** is standard
- Synergistic effect demonstrated

**2. Surgical Debridement:**

**Indications:**
- Necrotizing fasciitis
- Bullous lesions
- Evidence of tissue necrosis

**Timing:**
- **Within 12 hours:** Significantly ↓ mortality
- >24 hours: Much higher mortality

**Extent:**
- Aggressive debridement to viable tissue
- May require amputation
- Repeat debridement often needed

**3. Supportive Care:**
- Aggressive fluid resuscitation
- Vasopressors for shock
- ICU monitoring

---

**Prevention:**

**High-Risk Patients (Liver Disease, Immunosuppressed) Should:**
- **Avoid raw or undercooked shellfish** (especially oysters)
- Avoid seawater exposure if open wounds
- Wear protective clothing when handling seafood
- Cook oysters thoroughly (internal temp ≥145°F for 15 seconds)

**Public Health:**
- **CDC HAN 2023:** Increasing V. vulnificus infections due to warming coastal waters
- Education for high-risk patients

---

**Mnemonic: "VULNIFICUS = Vicious Oyster Bug"**
- **V**ery high mortality (>50% sepsis)
- **U**rgent debridement (<12h)
- **L**iver disease = #1 risk
- **N**ecrotizing fasciitis
- **I**mmunity low (risk factor)
- **F**ever + bullae = sepsis
- **I**ron overload (hemochromatosis)
- **C**eftazidime + doxycycline
- **U**ncooked oysters (raw seafood)
- **S**eawater wound exposure

**Clinical Pearls:**
- **V. vulnificus = most lethal foodborne pathogen in the US**
- **Bullous skin lesions + liver disease + oysters** = V. vulnificus sepsis (classic triad)
- **Pain out of proportion** = early necrotizing fasciitis
- **Time to surgery matters:** <12h → survival, >24h → death
- Think V. vulnificus in any patient with cirrhosis presenting with sepsis after seafood consumption
- Mortality remains high (~50%) even with appropriate treatment if delayed
- Climate change → expect more cases as waters warm (CDC warning)
