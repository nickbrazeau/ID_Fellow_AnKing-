## Helicobacter pylori: Diagnosis

**Q:** What are the indications for testing and diagnostic methods for Helicobacter pylori infection?

**A:**

**Microbiology:**
- **Gram-negative, spiral-shaped rod** (curved, S-shaped, or helical)
- **Urease-positive** (produces ammonia → neutralizes gastric acid)
- Motile (multiple polar flagella)
- Microaerophilic

**Epidemiology:**
- Infects ~50% of world population (higher in developing countries)
- Acquired in childhood (typically <5 years)
- Chronic infection (persists for life unless treated)

---

**Clinical Indications for Testing:**

**Test-and-Treat Strategy (2024 ACG Guidelines):**

**Absolute Indications:**
1. **Peptic ulcer disease** (active or history)
2. **Gastric MALT lymphoma**
3. **Early gastric cancer** (post-endoscopic resection)
4. **Unexplained iron deficiency anemia**
5. **Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)**
6. **Dyspepsia** (in patients <60 years without alarm features)

**Relative Indications:**
- Long-term aspirin or NSAID use (starting therapy)
- First-degree relatives with gastric cancer
- Patient preference after discussion

**DO NOT Test:**
- Asymptomatic individuals (unless family history of gastric cancer)
- Patients on PPI/antibiotics (interferes with testing)

---

**Diagnostic Methods:**

**Non-Invasive Tests (Preferred for Initial Diagnosis):**

**1. Urea Breath Test (UBT) [GOLD STANDARD]:**

**Mechanism:**
- Patient ingests ¹³C-urea or ¹⁴C-urea
- **H. pylori urease** cleaves urea → labeled CO₂
- Labeled CO₂ detected in breath

**Performance:**
- **Sensitivity: 90-100%**
- **Specificity: 90-100%**
- Most accurate non-invasive test

**Requirements:**
- Stop **PPI x 2 weeks** before test
- Stop **antibiotics/bismuth x 4 weeks** before test
- Fasting 1-2 hours before test

**Advantages:**
- High accuracy
- Excellent for **test-of-cure** (≥4 weeks post-treatment)

**Disadvantages:**
- Expensive
- Not widely available
- Requires patient compliance (fasting, no medications)

**2. Stool Antigen Test (SAT):**

**Mechanism:**
- Detects **H. pylori antigens** in stool using ELISA or immunochromatography

**Performance:**
- **Sensitivity: 90-95%**
- **Specificity: 90-95%**
- **Monoclonal antibody tests** more accurate than polyclonal

**Requirements:**
- Stop **PPI x 2 weeks** before test
- Stop **antibiotics/bismuth x 4 weeks** before test

**Advantages:**
- Inexpensive
- Widely available
- Good for initial diagnosis and test-of-cure

**Disadvantages:**
- Slightly less accurate than UBT
- Patient may find stool collection inconvenient

**3. Serology (H. pylori IgG Antibody):**

**Mechanism:**
- Detects **IgG antibodies** to H. pylori in blood

**Performance:**
- Sensitivity: 80-95%
- Specificity: 80-90%

**Advantages:**
- Inexpensive
- Not affected by PPI/antibiotics
- Useful for patients on PPI who cannot stop

**Disadvantages:**
- **Cannot distinguish active from past infection** (antibodies persist for years after eradication)
- **NOT useful for test-of-cure**
- Lower accuracy in low-prevalence populations

**Recommendation:**
- Use for initial diagnosis ONLY if UBT/SAT unavailable
- **Never use for test-of-cure**

---

**Invasive Tests (Require Endoscopy):**

**4. Rapid Urease Test (RUT) [e.g., CLOtest]:**

**Mechanism:**
- Gastric biopsy placed in urea + pH indicator
- **H. pylori urease** cleaves urea → ammonia → ↑ pH → color change (yellow → pink/red)
- Results in 1-24 hours (usually 1-2 hours)

**Performance:**
- Sensitivity: 90-95%
- Specificity: 95-100%

**Requirements:**
- Endoscopy with biopsy
- Stop **PPI x 2 weeks**, **antibiotics x 4 weeks**

**5. Histology (Gold Standard for Endoscopy-Based Diagnosis):**

**Mechanism:**
- Gastric biopsy → H&E stain ± Giemsa or Warthin-Starry silver stain
- Visualize **spiral organisms** in gastric mucosa

**Performance:**
- Sensitivity: 90-95%
- Specificity: 95-100%
- **Most accurate invasive test**

**Advantages:**
- Assesses mucosal pathology (gastritis, atrophy, metaplasia, dysplasia)
- Can assess density of H. pylori

**6. Culture:**

**Indications:**
- **Antibiotic susceptibility testing** (for treatment failures)
- Research purposes

**Disadvantages:**
- Slow (5-7 days)
- Technically difficult
- Expensive
- Not routinely performed

**7. PCR (Biopsy-Based):**

**Advantages:**
- Rapid
- Can detect **clarithromycin resistance genes** (23S rRNA mutations)

**Disadvantages:**
- Expensive
- Not widely available

---

**Test-of-Cure (Post-Treatment Verification):**

**Indications for Post-Treatment Testing:**
- **All patients treated for H. pylori** should have test-of-cure
- Timing: **≥4 weeks after completing treatment**

**Recommended Tests:**
- **Urea breath test (UBT)** - preferred
- **Stool antigen test (SAT)** - acceptable alternative

**NOT Recommended:**
- Serology (antibodies persist after eradication)

**Requirements:**
- Stop **PPI x 2 weeks** before test
- Complete antibiotics ≥4 weeks before test

**Comparison Table:**

| **Test** | **Sensitivity** | **Specificity** | **Active Infection?** | **Test-of-Cure?** | **Affected by PPI?** |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **UBT** | 90-100% | 90-100% | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (preferred) | ✅ Yes (stop x 2 wks) |
| **Stool Ag** | 90-95% | 90-95% | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (stop x 2 wks) |
| **Serology** | 80-95% | 80-90% | ❌ No (past or present) | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **RUT (CLOtest)** | 90-95% | 95-100% | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (stop x 2 wks) |
| **Histology** | 90-95% | 95-100% | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (stop x 2 wks) |
| **Culture** | 70-90% | 100% | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

**Mnemonic: "UBT = Urea Breaks To CO₂"**
- **U**rea breath test
- **B**reaks urea with urease
- **T**o CO₂ (detected in breath)

**Mnemonic: "SAT for STAT diagnosis"**
- **S**tool **A**ntigen **T**est
- **S**ensitive
- **T**est-of-cure
- **A**cceptable alternative to UBT
- **T**iming: ≥4 weeks post-treatment

**Clinical Pearls:**
- **UBT = gold standard non-invasive test** (90-100% sensitivity/specificity)
- **Serology CANNOT distinguish active from past infection** → not for test-of-cure
- **PPI suppresses H. pylori** → false-negative tests (stop x 2 weeks)
- **Test-of-cure is MANDATORY** for all treated patients (≥4 weeks post-treatment)
- If initial serology positive → confirm with UBT or SAT before treating
- **Culture reserved for treatment failures** (antibiotic susceptibility testing)
- PCR can detect clarithromycin resistance (useful in high-resistance areas)
