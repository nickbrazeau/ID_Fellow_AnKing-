## Rubella Virus (German Measles)

**Q:** What are the clinical features of postnatal rubella and congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), and what is the MMR vaccine efficacy?

**A:**

**Postnatal Rubella (Acquired Infection):**

**Clinical Features:**
- Mild, self-limited illness
- Low-grade fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy (postauricular, suboccipital, posterior cervical)
- Arthralgias (more common in adults, especially women)
- **Rash**: Erythematous maculopapular, starts face → spreads downward, lasts **3-5 days**
- **Forchheimer spots** (20%): Pinpoint petechiae on soft palate → coalesce into red blush

**Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS):**

**Risk by Gestational Age:**
- **≤12 weeks gestation**: **Up to 85% of neonates** affected
- Later infection: Lower risk

**Classic CRS Triad + Additional Features:**

| System | Manifestations | Frequency |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| **Auditory** | **Sensorineural hearing loss** (most common) | **58%** |
| **Ophthalmologic** | Cataracts, infantile glaucoma, pigmentary retinopathy | **43%** |
| **Cardiac** | Patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary stenosis, VSD | Common |
| **CNS** | Microcephaly, intellectual disability | Variable |
| **Dermatologic** | **"Blueberry muffin" rash** (dermal erythropoiesis) | Classic finding |
| **Other** | Thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, radiolucent bone disease | Variable |

**MMR Vaccine:**

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Strain** | Live attenuated RA 27/3 |
| **Schedule** | **Dose 1**: 12-15 months; **Dose 2**: 4-6 years |
| **Efficacy** | **93-97% after 1 dose**, **100% after 2 doses** |
| **Contraindication** | Pregnancy (theoretical teratogenicity risk; wait 1 month post-vaccine before conception) |

**Key Points:**
- Rubella is mild in children/adults but **devastating in pregnancy** (CRS)
- **Most common CRS manifestation**: Sensorineural hearing loss (58%)
- Forchheimer spots: Soft palate petechiae (20% of cases)

**Mnemonic - CRS "Hearing, Heart, Hazy eyes"**:
- **H**earing loss (58%)
- **H**eart defects (PDA, PS)
- **H**azy vision (cataracts, glaucoma)

**Pearl:** Rubella infection in first trimester causes CRS in up to 85% of neonates. Sensorineural hearing loss is the most common manifestation (58%). MMR vaccine is 100% effective after 2 doses.
