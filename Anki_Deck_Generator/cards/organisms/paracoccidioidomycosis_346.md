## Paracoccidioidomycosis (South American Blastomycosis)

**Q:** What is the pathognomonic "mariner's wheel" appearance, geographic distribution, clinical syndromes, and treatment of paracoccidioidomycosis?

**A:**

**Overview:**
- Endemic mycosis caused by ***Paracoccidioides brasiliensis*** and ***P. lutzii***
- **Geographic distribution**: **Latin America** (endemic in humid tropical/subtropical regions)
  - **Brazil accounts for 80% of cases worldwide**
  - Also: Venezuela, Colombia, Argentina, Ecuador, Paraguay
- **Most common systemic mycosis in Latin America**

**Pathognomonic Finding - "Mariner's Wheel" or "Pilot's Wheel":**

**Yeast Form Appearance:**
- **Central mother cell** (10-30 μm) with **multiple budding daughter cells** (2-10 μm) attached around periphery
- Buds connected via **narrow-based, isthmus-like connections** (narrow necks)
- Creates appearance of **ship's steering wheel** with spokes radiating from hub
- **Lemon-shaped or oval buds** arranged circumferentially around central cell
- **Highly characteristic** of *Paracoccidioides* species (helps distinguish from other endemic fungi)

**Risk Factors:**
- **Male predominance**: 10-15:1 (males > females)
- Agricultural workers, farmers (soil exposure)
- Reactivation years/decades after initial exposure (similar to TB, histoplasmosis)

**Clinical Syndromes:**

| Form | Clinical Features | Demographics | Organs Involved |
|------|------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Acute/subacute (juvenile)** | Fever, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, weight loss, skin lesions | **<30 years** (3% of cases) | Reticuloendothelial system (lymph nodes, liver, spleen, bone marrow) |
| **Chronic (adult)** | **Oral ulcers** (mulberry-like stomatitis), pulmonary disease (chronic cough, dyspnea), skin lesions (ulcers, papules), laryngeal involvement (hoarseness) | **>30 years** (most common: 30-60 years); 97% of cases | Lungs (most common), mucosa (oral, nasal, larynx), skin, adrenals |

**Most Common Presentation:**
- **Chronic pulmonary form**: Cough, dyspnea, weight loss (mimics TB, lung cancer)
- **Oral ulcers**: Painful, granulomatous, "mulberry-like" stomatitis on palate, gingiva, tongue
- **Skin lesions**: Papules, nodules, ulcers with raised borders

**Diagnosis:**
- **Histology**: **"Mariner's wheel"** yeast forms on tissue (pathognomonic)
- **Culture**: Slow-growing mycelial form at 25°C (weeks)
- **Serology**: Double immunodiffusion (useful for diagnosis and monitoring treatment response)
- **KOH prep/wet mount**: May visualize characteristic yeast
- **Imaging**: CXR shows bilateral reticulonodular infiltrates (mimics TB, sarcoidosis)

**Treatment (2024):**

| Severity | First-Line | Duration | Notes |
|----------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Mild-moderate** | **Itraconazole 200 mg PO BID** | **9-18 months** | More effective, shorter duration, better tolerated than TMP-SMX |
| | **Alternative**: TMP-SMX 160/800 mg PO BID | 12-24 months | **Cost-effective alternative** in Latin America (still widely used due to lower cost) |
| **Severe (CNS, disseminated)** | **Amphotericin B IV** (liposomal or deoxycholate) | **2-4 weeks** → step down to itraconazole | Induction with AmB, then oral consolidation |

**Itraconazole vs TMP-SMX:**
- **Itraconazole**: More effective, shorter treatment duration (9-18 vs 12-24 months), better tolerated
- **TMP-SMX**: Lower cost; still widely used in Latin America due to resource constraints
- **Cure rates**: Itraconazole >90%, TMP-SMX 70-80%

**Treatment Monitoring:**
- **Serology**: Declining antibody titers indicate treatment response
- **Clinical**: Resolution of oral ulcers, skin lesions, pulmonary symptoms
- **Duration**: Must complete full course to prevent relapse

**Key Points:**
- **"Mariner's wheel" yeast**: Pathognomonic (multiple lemon-shaped buds around central cell)
- **Endemic**: Latin America (Brazil 80% of cases)
- **Oral ulcers**: Most common mucosal manifestation (mulberry-like stomatitis)
- **Treatment**: Itraconazole × 9-18 months (mild-moderate); amphotericin B → itraconazole (severe)
- **Male predominance**: 10-15:1
- **Reactivation disease**: Years/decades after initial exposure

**Mnemonic - "Paracoccidioidomycosis = Pilot's wheel (mariner's), Paulo (Brazil), Painful oral ulcers"**

**Pearl:** Paracoccidioidomycosis is endemic to Latin America (Brazil 80% of cases) and diagnosed by pathognomonic "mariner's wheel" or "pilot's wheel" yeast form (multiple narrow-based budding cells around central mother cell). Most common presentation: chronic pulmonary disease with oral ulcers (mulberry-like stomatitis). Treatment: itraconazole 200 mg BID × 9-18 months (more effective than TMP-SMX but TMP-SMX still widely used in Latin America due to lower cost). Male predominance 10-15:1.
