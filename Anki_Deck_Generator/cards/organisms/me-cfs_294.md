## Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS)

**Q:** What are the diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS, and what is the hallmark symptom?

**A:**

**Diagnostic Criteria (symptoms >6 months, moderate-severe intensity ≥50% of time):**

**Required:**
1. **Profound fatigue**:
   - New/defined onset (not lifelong)
   - Unrelated to exertion
   - NOT relieved by rest
   - Substantial reduction in function

2. **Post-exertional malaise (PEM)** - HALLMARK SYMPTOM:
   - Worsening of illness after minor physical/mental activity
   - Onset: immediate to hours-days after activity
   - Duration: days to weeks
   - Disproportionate to activity level

3. **Unrefreshing sleep**

4. **Cognitive impairment** OR **orthostatic intolerance**:
   - Cognitive: "brain fog," memory problems, difficulty concentrating
   - Orthostatic: worsening symptoms upon standing

**Major Diagnostic Criteria Sets:**
- **1994 Fukuda Criteria**
- **2003 Canadian Consensus Criteria**
- **2015 IOM (Institute of Medicine) Criteria** - adopted by CDC

**Post-Viral Association:**
- Often triggered by infection (EBV, enterovirus, COVID-19)
- **ICD-11 classification**: Listed under "post-viral fatigue syndrome"
- Many long COVID patients meet ME/CFS criteria

**Diagnosis:**
- **Clinical diagnosis** (no specific lab test/imaging)
- **Rule out other conditions** (differential diagnosis essential)

**Pearl:** PEM distinguishes ME/CFS from depression/deconditioning; activity worsens symptoms rather than improves them.
