## Chromoblastomycosis

**Q:** What are the causative agents, clinical features, diagnostic findings, and treatment of chromoblastomycosis?

**A:**

**Overview:**
- Chronic subcutaneous fungal infection caused by **pigmented (dematiaceous) fungi**
- Endemic: Tropical/subtropical regions (Latin America, Africa, Asia, Australia)
- Transmission: **Traumatic inoculation** (thorns, wood splinters, plant material)

**Causative Organisms:**

| Most Common Causes | Geographic Distribution |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| ***Fonsecaea pedrosoi*** (most common worldwide) | Latin America, Asia |
| ***Fonsecaea monophora*** | China, Southeast Asia |
| ***Cladophialophora carrionii*** | Madagascar, Venezuela, Australia |
| ***Phialophora verrucosa*** | Worldwide (less common) |
| ***Rhinocladiella aquaspersa*** | Rare |

**Clinical Features:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Lesion appearance** | **Verrucous (cauliflower-like) plaques** that are wartlike, raised, and irregular; slow progression over years |
| **Location** | **Extremities** (legs > arms; feet/ankles most common) |
| **Evolution** | Starts as small papule → expands to large verrucous plaque with satellite lesions |
| **Color** | Brown, violaceous, or pink |
| **Complications** | Secondary bacterial infection, lymphedema, elephantiasis (chronic cases), rarely dissemination |

**Pathognomonic Diagnostic Finding:**

**"Copper Pennies" (Sclerotic/Muriform Bodies):**
- **Appearance**: Round, thick-walled, brown pigmented cells (5-12 μm)
- **Morphology**: Septate in 1-2 planes → "coins stacked together"
- **KOH prep**: Multiple round brownish budding bodies resembling different denominations of copper pennies
- **Histology**: Pigmented yeasts in dermis with granulomatous inflammation

**Diagnosis:**
- **KOH prep**: Sclerotic bodies visible
- **Histology**: Granulomatous dermatitis with multinucleated giant cells containing sclerotic bodies
- **Culture**: Slow-growing pigmented colonies (2-4 weeks); identification requires DNA sequencing
- **Tissue biopsy**: Gold standard

**Treatment (2024 Guidelines):**

| Severity | First-Line | Duration | Notes |
|----------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Small lesions (<5 cm)** | **Itraconazole 200 mg PO BID**<br>OR<br>**Terbinafine 250 mg PO BID** | **6-12 months** | Terbinafine may offer better absorption, fewer drug-drug interactions |
| **Moderate-large lesions** | **Combination therapy:**<br>Itraconazole + terbinafine | **12-24 months** | Better response rates than monotherapy |
| **Refractory disease** | Voriconazole or posaconazole | Variable | For azole-resistant cases |
| **Adjunctive therapy** | Surgical excision, cryotherapy, local heat, photodynamic therapy | - | For small localized lesions |

**Terbinafine vs Itraconazole:**
- **Terbinafine advantages**: Better absorption, fewer drug-drug interactions, allylamine class (different mechanism)
- **Itraconazole**: Traditional first-line; azole class
- **Combination**: Synergistic; recommended for moderate-large lesions

**Alternative/Adjunctive Therapies:**
- **5-Flucytosine**: Used in combination with itraconazole for severe/refractory cases
- **Cryotherapy**: Liquid nitrogen for small early lesions
- **Local heat therapy**: Pocketed heating devices
- **Photodynamic therapy**: Emerging treatment option
- **Surgical excision**: For small, localized lesions only (risk of recurrence)

**Key Points:**
- **Copper pennies**: Pathognomonic sclerotic bodies on histology
- **Verrucous plaques**: Cauliflower-like appearance on extremities
- **Slow progression**: Years to decades
- **Treatment**: Itraconazole or terbinafine (combination for larger lesions) × 6-24 months
- **Surgery alone**: High recurrence rate; use as adjunct

**Mnemonic - "Chrome Coins = Chromoblastomycosis, Copper penny sclerotic bodies, Cauliflower verrucous plaques"**

**Pearl:** Chromoblastomycosis is diagnosed by pathognomonic "copper penny" sclerotic bodies (muriform cells) on KOH or histology. *Fonsecaea pedrosoi* most common cause. Presents as slow-growing verrucous (cauliflower-like) plaques on extremities after traumatic inoculation (thorns, wood). Treatment: itraconazole or terbinafine (better for combination therapy) × 6-24 months. Terbinafine offers advantages: better absorption, fewer drug interactions.
