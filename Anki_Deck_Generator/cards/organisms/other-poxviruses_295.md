## Other Poxviruses: Parapoxviruses, Molluscum, Yatapoxviruses

**Q:** What are the clinical features and transmission of molluscum contagiosum, orf/milker's nodule, and tanapox?

**A:**

| Poxvirus Genus | Disease | Transmission | Clinical Features | Treatment |
|----------------|---------|--------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Molluscipoxvirus** | **Molluscum contagiosum** | Human-to-human (direct contact, fomites, sexual) | **Umbilicated papules** (2-5 mm), flesh-colored, self-limited | **Self-resolving** (within 1 year); cryotherapy, curettage if desired |
| **Parapoxvirus** | **Orf** ("ecthyma contagiosum") | **Sheep/goat** saliva exposure | **Single nodule** (hands/arms), 6 stages over 14-72 days (maculopapular → target → papillomatous → regress) | **Self-limited** (4-6 weeks); topical cidofovir for persistent lesions |
| **Parapoxvirus** | **Milker's nodule/pseudocowpox** | **Cattle** exposure (paravaccinia virus) | **Identical to orf** (hands/arms) | **Self-limited** (4-6 weeks) |
| **Yatapoxvirus** | **Tanapox** | **Nonhuman primates** (arthropod vector likely) | Fever + **1-2 large nodules** (arms/face), equatorial Africa endemic | **Self-limited** |

**Key Distinctions:**

**Molluscum Contagiosum:**
- **Only replicates in human keratinocytes**
- **Immunocompromised (HIV)**: extensive, disfiguring lesions (CD4 <100)
- Diagnosis: clinical (central umbilication pathognomonic)

**Orf/Milker's Nodule:**
- **Occupational exposure** (farmers, veterinarians, abattoir workers)
- **Incubation**: 4-7 days
- **Complications (rare)**: erythema multiforme, secondary bacterial infection
- **Immunocompromised**: Giant orf (persistent, large lesions)

**Tanapox:**
- Endemic to **equatorial Africa**
- Mild systemic illness + localized skin lesions
- **No person-to-person transmission**

**Treatment for All:**
- Generally **self-limited** (supportive care)
- Consider **topical cidofovir** for immunocompromised or persistent lesions
- **Tecovirimat** reserved for severe/disseminated disease

**Pearl:** Orf has characteristic 6-stage progression; immunocompromised patients may develop "giant" forms requiring antiviral therapy.
