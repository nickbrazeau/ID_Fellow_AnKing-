## Orthoreoviruses and Orbiviruses

**Q:** How do orthoreoviruses and orbiviruses differ in transmission and human disease manifestations?

**A:**

**Family Reoviridae Genera Affecting Humans:**
- Orthoreovirus, Orbivirus, Rotavirus, Coltivirus, Seadornavirus

**Orthoreovirus:**

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Transmission** | **Fecal-oral** and respiratory routes |
| **Hosts** | Humans, mammals |
| **Human disease** | **Mild respiratory and enteric infections** (often asymptomatic) |
| **Clinical significance** | Limited pathogenicity in immunocompetent hosts |

**Orbivirus:**

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Transmission** | **Arthropod-borne** (mosquitoes, midges, gnats, sand flies, ticks) |
| **Hosts** | Primarily **animal pathogens** (sheep, cattle, horses) |
| **Human-pathogenic species** | **Kemerovo complex** (Russia/Eastern Europe), **Orungo** (sub-Saharan Africa), **Lebombo** (South Africa/Nigeria), **Changuinola** (Central America) |
| **Human cases** | **<100 reported worldwide** |
| **Clinical manifestations** | **Neurologic disease**: encephalitis, meningitis, meningoencephalitis, polyradiculitis; **acute febrile illness** |
| **Vascular tropism** | Infects endothelial cells → mimics **rickettsial illness** |
| **Outcomes** | Generally **self-limited**; NO deaths reported; full recovery typical |

**Major Animal Orbiviruses (Rarely Infect Humans):**

| Virus | Primary Hosts | Disease | Mortality |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| **Bluetongue virus (BTV)** | Sheep, cattle, goats, wild ungulates | Bluetongue disease | Variable |
| **African horse sickness virus (AHSV)** | Horses, donkeys, dogs | African horse sickness | **>90% in horses** |
| **Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV)** | Deer | Hemorrhagic disease | Variable |

**Key Distinctions:**
- **Orthoreoviruses**: Direct transmission, mild human disease
- **Orbiviruses**: Vector-borne, rare human infection (primarily veterinary importance)
- Human orbivirus disease mimics rickettsial illness (vascular endothelial tropism)

**Pearl:** Orbiviruses are predominantly animal pathogens causing severe veterinary disease (bluetongue, African horse sickness); human infections are rare (<100 cases) and generally self-limited.
