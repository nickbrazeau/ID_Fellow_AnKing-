## Coronaviruses: SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV

**Q:** How do SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV differ in mortality, transmission, and clinical features?

**A:**

**Comparison:**

| Feature | **SARS-CoV-1** | **MERS-CoV** |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| **Outbreak** | 2002-2003 (China origin); **>8,000 cases**, 774 deaths (28 countries); **NO cases since 2004** | **Ongoing** since 2012 (Saudi Arabia); sporadic cases (2024: 4 cases, 2 deaths) |
| **Reservoir** | Bats → civet cats → humans | **Dromedary camels** → humans |
| **Mortality (CFR)** | **~15%** overall; **>50% in age >65** | **35-36%** (may overestimate due to underreporting of mild cases) |
| **Transmission** | Human-to-human (healthcare, household); higher transmissibility | **Lower transmissibility**; requires close contact (healthcare/household); direct/indirect camel contact |
| **Incubation** | 2-7 days | **~5 days** |

**Clinical Manifestations:**

**Common Features (Both):**
- Fever, cough (most frequent)
- Myalgia, headache, chills
- **GI symptoms**: Diarrhea, nausea (MERS 30%, SARS 20%)
- **Severe ARDS** in severe cases

**Distinguishing Features:**
- **SARS**: Rhinorrhea in children; resembles adult disease in adolescents
- **MERS**: More severe clinical picture (higher hospitalization rate)

**Treatment:**

| Approach | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| **Supportive care** | Mainstay for both |
| **Ribavirin + interferon-alpha** | MERS: Improved 14-day survival in some studies; conflicting data on critically ill patients |
| **Remdesivir** | Broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus activity (inhibits SARS-CoV-1/MERS-CoV replication in vitro) |

**Infection Control:**
- Case identification + infection control measures prevent nosocomial/household transmission

**Key Points:**
- **SARS-CoV-1**: Eradicated (no cases since 2004); 15% mortality
- **MERS-CoV**: Ongoing sporadic cases (endemic in Middle East); **35% mortality** (highest of human coronaviruses); zoonotic (camels)
- MERS: **Lower transmissibility** but **higher mortality** than SARS

**Mnemonic - "MERS = More Elderly Risk, Sicker"**: Higher mortality (35% vs 15%), elderly at risk

**Pearl:** MERS-CoV has highest mortality (35%) of human coronaviruses but lower transmissibility than SARS. Dromedary camel exposure is key epidemiologic link. SARS-CoV-1 eradicated since 2004.
