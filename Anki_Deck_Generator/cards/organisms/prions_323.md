## Prions and Prion Diseases of the CNS

**Q:** What are the major human prion diseases, their transmission routes, and clinical features?

**A:**

**Overview:**
- **Prions**: Misfolded prion proteins (PrP^Sc^) that convert normal PrP^C^ → pathogenic form
- **Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies** (TSEs)
- **Invariably fatal**, **NO cure or effective treatment**
- **Incubation**: Months to decades

**Human Prion Diseases:**

| Disease | Type | Transmission/Cause | Incidence | Clinical Features |
|---------|------|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Sporadic CJD (sCJD)** | Sporadic (85-90%) | Unknown (spontaneous misfolding) | **1 per million/year** | Rapidly progressive dementia, myoclonus, ataxia; death in **6-12 months**; EEG: periodic sharp wave complexes |
| **Genetic CJD (gCJD)** | Genetic (10-15%) | **PRNP gene mutations** (autosomal dominant) | ~10-15% of CJD | Similar to sCJD |
| **Fatal Familial Insomnia (FFI)** | Genetic | **PRNP D178N mutation** | Rare | Progressive insomnia, autonomic dysfunction, dementia; death in months-years |
| **Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker (GSS)** | Genetic | **PRNP mutations** | Rare | Ataxia, dementia (slower than CJD); years survival |
| **Variant CJD (vCJD)** | Acquired | **BSE (mad cow disease)** - contaminated beef | Very rare (UK epidemic 1990s; now nearly eradicated) | **Psychiatric symptoms at onset**, younger age (median 28 years), death ~**14 months**; MRI: pulvinar sign |
| **Iatrogenic CJD (iCJD)** | Acquired | Contaminated **growth hormone, dura mater grafts, surgical instruments** | Rare (now prevented) | Similar to sCJD |
| **Kuru** | Acquired | **Cannibalism** (ritualistic consumption of brains, Fore people, Papua New Guinea) | **Eradicated** (practice banned 1950s) | Ataxia, tremors, emotional lability; "laughing death" |

**Clinical Features (sCJD - Most Common):**

**Triad:**
1. **Rapidly progressive dementia** (weeks to months)
2. **Myoclonus** (involuntary muscle jerking)
3. **Ataxia** (cerebellar signs)

**Other features:**
- Visual disturbances, pyramidal/extrapyramidal signs
- **Akinetic mutism** (late stage)
- **Death within 6-12 months** (90% within 1 year)

**Diagnosis:**

| Test | Findings |
|------|----------|
| **EEG** | **Periodic sharp wave complexes** (classic for sCJD) |
| **MRI** | **DWI/FLAIR hyperintensity** in basal ganglia, cortex (sCJD); **pulvinar sign** (vCJD) |
| **CSF 14-3-3 protein** | Elevated (supportive but not specific) |
| **CSF RT-QuIC** | **High sensitivity/specificity** for prion detection (newer test) |
| **Brain biopsy** | Spongiform changes, PrP^Sc^ (definitive but rarely done) |

**Key Points:**
- **Sporadic CJD**: Most common (85-90%); 1/million/year; rapid dementia + myoclonus; death in 6-12 months
- **vCJD**: Linked to BSE (mad cow); psychiatric onset; younger patients; nearly eradicated (2020: 0 UK deaths)
- **Kuru**: Eradicated (cannibalism banned 1950s)
- **NO treatment** or cure; invariably fatal

**Mnemonic - "Prions = Protein Rapidly Induces Ongoing Neurodegeneration Spongiform"**

**Pearl:** Sporadic CJD causes rapidly progressive dementia, myoclonus, and ataxia with death in 6-12 months. Variant CJD (mad cow disease) presents with psychiatric symptoms at younger age (median 28 years) and has been nearly eradicated. NO treatment exists for any prion disease.
