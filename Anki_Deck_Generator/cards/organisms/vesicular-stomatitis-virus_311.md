## Vesicular Stomatitis Virus and Related Vesiculoviruses

**Q:** What is the epidemiology, transmission, and clinical presentation of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in humans?

**A:**

**Virus Classification:**
- **Family**: Rhabdoviridae
- **Genus**: Vesiculovirus
- **Species**: Indiana vesiculovirus (most common)

**Epidemiology:**

**Primary Hosts:**
- **Livestock**: Cattle, horses, pigs
- Causes **vesicular lesions** (muzzle, lips, tongue, ears, udder, coronary bands)
- **Vector-borne**: Insect transmission (black flies, sandflies, midges)

**Human Zoonotic Infection:**
- **Occupational exposure**: Laboratory workers, veterinarians, livestock handlers
- **Rare** in general population

**Transmission to Humans:**
- Contact with infected animal **oral/nasal secretions** or **vesicle fluid**
- Via **mucous membranes** (eyes, nose, mouth) or **open skin wounds**

**Human Clinical Manifestations:**

**Typical Course:**
- **Self-limited flu-like illness** (3-5 days)
- Fever (often **biphasic**)
- Severe malaise, headache, myalgia, arthralgia
- Retrosternal pain, eye aches, nausea
- **Vesicular lesions of mouth** (occasionally)

**Severe Disease (Rare):**
- Encephalitis (very rare)

**Key Points:**
- **Primarily veterinary disease** (livestock with vesicular lesions)
- **Human infection rare**, mostly occupational
- Mimics **influenza-like illness**
- Self-limited (3-5 days)
- Distinguished from foot-and-mouth disease in livestock (important differential)

**Differential Diagnosis in Livestock:**
- Must distinguish VSV from **foot-and-mouth disease** (FMD) - both cause vesicular lesions
- Laboratory testing required for differentiation
- Major trade implications (FMD reportable disease)

**Pearl:** VSV causes occupational zoonotic infection in veterinarians and livestock handlers. Human disease is self-limited flu-like illness (3-5 days) with occasional oral vesicular lesions. Encephalitis is very rare.
