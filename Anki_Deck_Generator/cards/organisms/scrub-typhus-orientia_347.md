## Scrub Typhus (Orientia tsutsugamushi)

**Q:** What are the clinical features, eschar characteristics, geographic distribution ("tsutsugamushi triangle"), and antibiotic resistance patterns for scrub typhus?

**A:**

**Overview:**
- **Organism**: ***Orientia tsutsugamushi*** (intracellular bacterium; family Rickettsiaceae)
- **Vector**: **Larval trombiculid mites (chiggers)** (*Leptotrombidium* species)
- **Geographic distribution**: **"Tsutsugamushi triangle"** (Asia-Pacific region)
  - Encompasses >8 million km² affecting >1 billion people
  - Japan, Korea, China, India, Southeast Asia, Northern Australia, Pacific Islands
- **Prevalence**: 1 million cases/year; significant public health concern in endemic areas

**Clinical Features:**

| Timing | Symptoms | Frequency |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Incubation** | 6-21 days (median 10-12 days) | - |
| **Early (Days 1-7)** | **Fever** (38-40°C), severe **headache**, **myalgia**, chills, nausea, vomiting | >90% |
| | **Eschar** at bite site (pathognomonic) | **7-80%** (varies by geographic region; higher in Asia, lower in Pacific Islands) |
| **Week 2** | **Maculopapular rash** (trunk → extremities, spares face/palms/soles) | 50-80% |
| | Generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly | 50% |
| **Severe** (untreated) | Pneumonitis, ARDS, meningoencephalitis, myocarditis, acute kidney injury, DIC | 10-15% (mortality 0-70% if untreated) |

**Eschar (Pathognomonic Finding):**

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Appearance** | **Painless black necrotic ulcer** with raised erythematous border (1-2 cm) |
| **Evolution** | Papule → vesicle → ulcer with black crust (eschar) |
| **Location** | **Hidden areas**: axilla, groin, perineum, popliteal fossa, retroauricular, inframammary (where clothing is tight; chiggers attach) |
| **Frequency** | 7-80% (geographic variation) |
| **Timing** | Present at symptom onset (helps distinguish from other rickettsioses) |
| **Associated findings** | Regional lymphadenopathy draining eschar site |

**Key Clinical Pearl:**
- **Eschar + fever + myalgia** in patient with Asia-Pacific travel = scrub typhus until proven otherwise
- **Search hidden body areas** (axilla, groin, retroauricular) for eschar during exam

**Diagnosis:**
- **Serology**: IgM ELISA (most common); paired acute/convalescent titers (4-fold rise)
- **PCR**: Blood/eschar biopsy (early disease; not widely available)
- **Culture**: Rarely performed (requires BSL-3 facility)
- **Weil-Felix test**: Historical (nonspecific; low sensitivity; no longer recommended)

**Treatment:**

| Agent | Dosing | Duration | Efficacy | Notes |
|-------|--------|----------|----------|-------|
| **Doxycycline** (first-line) | **100 mg PO/IV BID** | **7-10 days** | >95% effective | Defervescence within 24-48h; safe in children for short courses |
| **Azithromycin** (alternative) | 500 mg PO daily × 3 days OR 10 mg/kg daily × 3 days | 3 days | Effective | Use in pregnancy, children; may have faster bacterial clearance than doxycycline |
| **Chloramphenicol** | 500 mg PO/IV QID | 7 days | Effective (historical) | Used when doxycycline/azithromycin unavailable |

**Antibiotic Resistance Controversy (2024 Update):**

**Historical Concerns (1990s):**
- Reports from northern Thailand suggested doxycycline treatment failures
- Attributed to "doxycycline-resistant" *O. tsutsugamushi* strains

**Current Evidence (2024):**
- **Independent verification lacking**: Original resistance claims not reproducible
- **In vitro studies**: Growth inhibited at 0.1 µg/mL doxycycline (including putatively resistant strains AFC-3, AFSC-4)
- **Conclusion**: **No confirmed doxycycline resistance**; prior failures likely due to delayed treatment or alternative diagnoses

**Emerging Concerns:**
- **Azithromycin resistance**: Some reports of treatment failures with azithromycin (not doxycycline)
- **Severe disease**: Combination therapy (doxycycline + azithromycin) may shorten bacterial DNA clearance time
- **Recommendation**: Doxycycline remains first-line; resistance not clinically significant

**Clinical Response:**
- **Defervescence**: Expected within **24-48 hours** of starting doxycycline
- **Delayed response**: Consider alternative diagnosis or complications (not resistance)

**Prevention:**
- Avoid chigger-infested areas (scrub vegetation, grasslands)
- Protective clothing, insect repellents (DEET, permethrin)
- No vaccine available

**Key Points:**
- **Eschar**: Painless black necrotic ulcer (pathognomonic); found in hidden areas (axilla, groin)
- **Geographic**: "Tsutsugamushi triangle" (Asia-Pacific; >1 billion people at risk)
- **Treatment**: Doxycycline 100 mg BID × 7-10 days (defervescence within 24-48h)
- **Resistance**: Historical concerns NOT supported by recent evidence; doxycycline remains first-line
- **Severe disease**: Can cause ARDS, encephalitis, myocarditis (10-15% untreated)

**Mnemonic - "Scrub typhus = Scrubby vegetation (chiggers), Eschar in Skin folds, Tsutsugamushi triangle (Asia-Pacific)"**

**Pearl:** Scrub typhus (Orientia tsutsugamushi) transmitted by larval mites (chiggers) in Asia-Pacific "tsutsugamushi triangle" (>1 billion at risk). Pathognomonic eschar (painless black ulcer) in hidden areas (axilla, groin, retroauricular) present in 7-80%. Classic triad: fever, eschar, myalgia. Treatment: doxycycline 100 mg BID × 7-10 days (defervescence within 24-48h). Historical doxycycline resistance concerns NOT supported by 2024 evidence; doxycycline remains first-line.
