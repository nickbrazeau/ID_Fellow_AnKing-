## Parainfluenza Viruses (HPIV)

**Q:** What are the clinical syndromes, seasonality, and treatment for the four human parainfluenza virus types?

**A:**

**Four HPIV Types and Associated Syndromes:**

| Type | Primary Clinical Syndrome | Age Group | Seasonality |
|------|---------------------------|-----------|-------------|
| **HPIV-1** | **Croup** (laryngotracheobronchitis) - **most common cause** | Infants/children 6-36 months | **Autumn** (biennial epidemics, alternating with HPIV-2) |
| **HPIV-2** | **Croup** | Infants/children | **Autumn** (biennial epidemics, alternates with HPIV-1) |
| **HPIV-3** | **Bronchiolitis, bronchitis, pneumonia** | Infants/young children | **Spring/early summer** (can occur year-round) |
| **HPIV-4** | Mild to severe respiratory illness (less commonly recognized) | All ages | **Fall/winter** (not well characterized) |

**Croup (Laryngotracheobronchitis):**

**Clinical Features:**
- **Barking cough** (seal-like)
- **Inspiratory stridor**
- Hoarseness
- Fever
- Typically affects children **6-36 months**

**Treatment:**

| Severity | Treatment |
|----------|-----------|
| **Mild** | **Supportive care** (hydration, humidified air) |
| **Moderate-Severe** | **Dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg PO/IM/IV** (single dose) OR **Budesonide 2 mg nebulized** |
| **Severe with distress** | **Nebulized racemic epinephrine 0.5 mL (2.25%)** + corticosteroids |

**General Treatment:**
- **NO specific antiviral** for HPIV
- Most cases require **symptom management only**
- Corticosteroids + nebulized epinephrine improve outcomes in severe croup

**Key Points:**
- **HPIV-1 and HPIV-2**: Croup pathogens (autumn biennial pattern)
- **HPIV-3**: Bronchiolitis/pneumonia (spring/summer, year-round possible)
- **Croup treatment**: Dexamethasone for moderate-severe; racemic epinephrine for severe distress

**Mnemonic - "1 and 2 = Croup for you; 3 = Bronchiolitis spree"**

**Pearl:** HPIV-1 is the most common cause of croup. HPIV-1 and HPIV-2 cause biennial autumn epidemics (alternating years). Dexamethasone is first-line for moderate-severe croup.
