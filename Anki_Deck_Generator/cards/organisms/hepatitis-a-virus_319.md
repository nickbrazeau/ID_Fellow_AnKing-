## Hepatitis A Virus (HAV)

**Q:** What are the transmission, clinical features, and prevention strategies for hepatitis A?

**A:**

**Overview:**
- **Picornaviridae family** (enterovirus-like)
- **Fecal-oral transmission** (contaminated food/water, person-to-person)
- **NO chronic infection** (unlike HBV, HCV)
- Part of "Big 5" foodborne pathogens (CDC/FDA)

**Transmission:**

| Route | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Fecal-oral** | Contaminated food/water (esp. shellfish), poor hand hygiene |
| **Person-to-person** | Household/sexual contact |
| **Peak infectivity** | **1-2 weeks BEFORE jaundice/symptoms** (high viral shedding in stool/blood) |

**Clinical Features:**

**Incubation:** **15-50 days** (average 28 days)

**Spectrum:**
- **Children <6 years**: Often **asymptomatic** (70%)
- **Older children/adults**: Usually **symptomatic** (jaundice, dark urine, fever, malaise, nausea, anorexia, abdominal pain)

**Complications:**
- **Fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure)**: Rare (<1%) but **up to 80% mortality**
- More common in: Adults >50, chronic liver disease patients
- **NO chronic hepatitis** (complete recovery typical)

**Laboratory:**
- **Elevated AST/ALT** (often >1000 IU/L)
- **Bilirubin elevated** (jaundice)
- **Anti-HAV IgM**: Acute infection
- **Anti-HAV IgG**: Past infection or immunity

**Vaccine:**

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Type** | Inactivated HAV vaccine |
| **Schedule** | **2 doses** (0 and 6-12 months apart) |
| **Efficacy** | >95% after 2 doses; **lifelong immunity** |
| **Indications** | All children (age 12-23 months), travelers to endemic areas, high-risk adults (MSM, PWID, chronic liver disease, food workers) |
| **US adult coverage** | **Only 8%** (2021 data) - very low |

**2024 Outbreaks:**
- **Los Angeles County**: 165 cases (3× increase from 2023)
- **Philadelphia**: Health alert issued (February 2024)
- Clusters among unhoused populations, food workers

**Key Points:**
- **Peak infectivity BEFORE symptoms** (1-2 weeks before jaundice)
- **NO chronic infection** (unlike HBV/HCV)
- **Fulminant hepatitis rare** (<1%) but 80% mortality
- Vaccine highly effective (>95%) but US adult coverage very low (8%)

**Pearl:** HAV is most infectious 1-2 weeks BEFORE symptoms appear (peak viral shedding). Fulminant hepatitis is rare (<1%) but has 80% mortality. Unlike HBV/HCV, HAV never causes chronic infection.
