## Fever Pathogenesis: Pyrogens and Thermoregulation

**Q:** What is the pathophysiologic pathway of fever generation from exogenous pyrogens to elevated body temperature?

**A:**

**Pathway (5 steps):**

1. **Exogenous pyrogens** (bacteria, viruses, toxins) → recognized by immune cells
2. **Endogenous pyrogens** released: **IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, IFN**
3. Cytokines act on **organum vasculosum lamina terminalis (OVLT)** in hypothalamus
4. **↑ COX-2 → ↑ PGE₂** synthesis (from arachidonic acid):
   - Phospholipase A₂ → arachidonic acid
   - COX → PGH₂
   - PGE synthase → **PGE₂**
5. **PGE₂ ↑ hypothalamic set point** → thermosensitive neurons activated → body:
   - ↑ Heat production (shivering, vasoconstriction)
   - ↓ Heat loss (peripheral vasoconstriction)

**Key Endogenous Pyrogens:**
- **IL-1** and **IL-6** (primary mediators)
- TNF-α
- Interferons (IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ)

**Antipyretic Mechanism:** NSAIDs/acetaminophen inhibit **COX** → ↓ PGE₂ → lower hypothalamic set point

**Pearl:** Fever is an **active process** requiring energy expenditure (unlike passive hyperthermia).
