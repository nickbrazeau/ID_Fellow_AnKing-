## Question

How is Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever managed? Use **"Tick Exposure + Fever + Rash (Palms/Soles) → Empiric Doxycycline 100mg BID, Do NOT Wait for Confirmation"** framework.

## Answer

### **Etiology:**

***Rickettsia rickettsii*** - obligate intracellular bacteria
- **Vector:** *Dermacentor* ticks (dog tick, wood tick)
- **Geography:** Southeastern US (despite name, NOT primarily Rocky Mountains)
- **Highest incidence:** North Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas, Oklahoma

### **Clinical Presentation:**

**Classic Triad (Only 3% Have All Three Initially):**
1. **Fever** (>90%)
2. **Rash** (90% by day 3, but only 50% at presentation)
3. **Tick bite history** (only 60% recall)

**Early (Days 1-3):**
- **Fever, chills** (abrupt onset)
- **Severe headache** (>90%)
- **Myalgias, malaise**
- **Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain**
- **Often NO rash** initially

**Late (Days 3-5):**
- **Rash** (90% by day 3):
  - **Maculopapular → petechial** (non-blanching)
  - **Starts peripherally** (wrists, ankles)
  - **Spreads centripetally** (trunk)
  - **Involves palms/soles** (40-80%, highly suggestive)
- **Severe disease:** Confusion, AMS, seizures, ARDS, shock, DIC

**Key:** **Absence of rash does NOT exclude RMSF** (especially early)

### **Diagnosis:**

**Clinical Diagnosis:**
- **High index of suspicion** (tick exposure + fever + headache in endemic area)
- **Do NOT wait for rash or confirmatory testing** to start treatment

**Labs (Non-Specific):**
- **Thrombocytopenia** (50-60%)
- **Hyponatremia** (50%)
- **↑Transaminases**
- **Leukopenia or leukocytosis**

**Confirmatory Tests (DO NOT DELAY TREATMENT):**

**Serology (Indirect Immunofluorescence Assay, IFA):**
- **Acute + convalescent titers** (2-4 weeks apart)
- **≥4-fold rise** in titer = diagnostic
- **Acute serology NEGATIVE** in first week (IgG appears 7-10 days)
- **Retrospective confirmation only** (NOT useful acutely)

**PCR:**
- **Skin biopsy** (rash), blood
- **Sensitivity 70%** (early disease)

**Immunohistochemistry:**
- **Skin biopsy** of rash (detects *Rickettsia* in endothelial cells)
- **Sensitivity 70%** (early)

### **Treatment:**

**Empiric Therapy (Start IMMEDIATELY if Suspected):**

**First-Line (ALL Ages, Including Children <8y):**
- **Doxycycline 100mg PO/IV BID × 5-7 days** (or until afebrile × 3 days)
  - **Children:** 2.2 mg/kg/dose BID (max 100mg/dose)
  - **Short course safe in children** (dental staining minimal with <21 days cumulative)

**Do NOT Use:**
- **Chloramphenicol** (historical alternative, higher mortality, NOT recommended)

**Duration:**
- **Continue until afebrile × 3 days** (minimum 5-7 days total)

**Supportive Care:**
- **IV fluids** (hypovolemia common)
- **ICU if severe** (ARDS, shock, AMS)

### **Complications:**

**Severe Disease (If Delayed Treatment):**
- **Vasculitis** (endothelial infection → vascular leak, thrombosis)
- **CNS:** Meningoencephalitis, seizures, focal deficits
- **Pulmonary:** ARDS, pulmonary edema
- **Renal:** Acute kidney injury
- **Cardiovascular:** Myocarditis, arrhythmias
- **Hematologic:** DIC, thrombocytopenia
- **Skin:** Necrosis, gangrene (digits, extremities)

### **Prognosis:**

**Mortality:**
- **Untreated:** 20-30%
- **Treated (early, <5 days):** <5%
- **Treated (late, >5 days):** 10-15%

**Risk Factors for Death:**
- **Delayed treatment** (>5 days after symptom onset)
- **Age >40 years**
- **G6PD deficiency** (hemolysis with oxidative stress)
- **Absence of rash** (delays diagnosis)

### **Prevention:**

**Tick Avoidance:**
- **DEET repellent, permethrin-treated clothing**
- **Tick checks after outdoor exposure**
- **Remove ticks promptly** (<6h attachment may reduce transmission risk, though not well-defined for RMSF)

**No Prophylaxis:**
- **Do NOT give prophylactic antibiotics** after tick bite (unlike Lyme disease)
- **Monitor for symptoms** × 14 days

### **Differential Diagnosis:**

**Other Tick-Borne Illnesses:**
- **Ehrlichiosis** (*Ehrlichia chaffeensis*, *E. ewingii*)
- **Anaplasmosis** (*Anaplasma phagocytophilum*)
- **Lyme disease** (*Borrelia burgdorferi*)

**Other Febrile Illnesses with Rash:**
- **Meningococcemia** (purpura, fulminant)
- **Secondary syphilis** (palms/soles, but maculopapular, not petechial)
- **Viral exanthems** (measles, rubella, enterovirus)

## Key Points

### **Do NOT Wait for Rash or Confirmation:**
- **Rash absent in 50%** at presentation, 10% never develop rash
- **Serology negative** in first week
- **Mortality increases with delayed treatment**

### **Empiric Doxycycline Immediately:**
- **100mg PO/IV BID** (start if suspected)
- **Safe in children <8y** (short course, minimal dental staining)

### **Classic Rash = Petechial, Palms/Soles:**
- **Starts peripherally** (wrists, ankles) → spreads centrally
- **Involves palms/soles** (highly suggestive)
- **Appears day 3-5** (not initially)

### **High Mortality if Delayed Treatment:**
- **<5 days:** Mortality <5%
- **>5 days:** Mortality 10-15%

### **Tick Exposure + Fever + Headache = Treat:**
- **Do NOT wait for rash** (may be absent)
- **Do NOT wait for serology** (negative early)

### **Clinical Pearls:**
- **Tick exposure + fever + headache** → empiric doxycycline 100mg BID (do NOT wait)
- **Rash absent initially** (50% at presentation, 10% never develop)
- **Petechial rash, palms/soles** (appears day 3-5)
- **Serology negative early** (IgG appears day 7-10)
- **Delayed treatment = high mortality** (treat empirically if suspected)
- **Safe in children <8y** (short course doxycycline, minimal dental risk)
