## The Common Cold: Etiology and Management

**Q:** What are the most common causes of the common cold, and what are the key clinical features distinguishing it from other respiratory infections?

**A:**

**Etiology (>200 respiratory viruses):**
- **Rhinovirus** (50% of colds) - >100 serotypes
- **Coronaviruses** (common human strains, NOT SARS-CoV-2)
- Parainfluenza, adenovirus, enterovirus, human metapneumovirus

**Clinical Features:**
- **Incubation:** 24-72 hours
- **Symptoms:** Scratchy/sore throat → sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, malaise
- **Temperature:** Usually **normal** (esp. rhinovirus/coronavirus)
- **Duration:** <7-10 days (self-limited)

**Key Distinctions:**
- **SARS-CoV-2, influenza, RSV** cause cold-like symptoms but are **NOT** common colds
- **Absence of fever** suggests viral URI over influenza/COVID
- **No lower respiratory symptoms** (unlike bronchitis/pneumonia)

**Management:**
- **Supportive care only** (rest, fluids, symptomatic relief)
- **Antibiotics NOT indicated** (viral etiology)
- NSAIDs/acetaminophen for discomfort
- Decongestants, antihistamines for symptom relief

**Pearl:** Rhinovirus accounts for half of all colds; no antiviral therapy available.
