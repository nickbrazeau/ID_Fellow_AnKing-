## Septic Emboli - Cavitation Patterns

**Q:** What are the timing, characteristics, and clinical significance of cavitation in septic pulmonary emboli?

**A:**

## DEFINITION

**Cavitary Septic Emboli:** **"Septic pulmonary emboli that undergo central necrosis forming cavities"**

**Incidence:** 30-50% of septic emboli develop cavitation

**Key Point:** **Cavitation in 30-50%** of septic emboli (abscess formation)

---

## PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

**Mechanism:**

1. **Infected embolus lodges** in peripheral pulmonary artery
2. **Vascular occlusion** → ischemic infarction
3. **Bacterial proliferation** → tissue necrosis
4. **Central liquefaction** → necrotic center forms
5. **Communication with bronchus** → air enters cavity
6. **Cavitary nodule** forms

**Key Point:** **Infarction + infection → necrosis → cavitation**

---

## TIMING OF CAVITATION

**Temporal Evolution:**

**Week 0-1 (Acute):**
- **Solid nodules**
- **Ground-glass halo** (hemorrhagic infarction)
- **No cavitation yet**

**Week 1-2 (Subacute):**
- **Cavitation begins** (thin-walled)
- **Air-fluid levels** may appear
- **Most cavities visible by 2 weeks**

**Week 2+ (Chronic):**
- **Well-formed cavities** (thick or thin-walled)
- **Abscess formation** (if thick-walled with air-fluid level)

**Key Point:** **Cavitation develops 1-2 weeks after embolization**

---

## CAVITY CHARACTERISTICS

**Wall Thickness:** Variable
- **Thin-walled** (<4mm) - 40-50%
- **Thick-walled** (>4mm) - 50-60%

**Size:** 0.5-5cm (variable)

**Number:** Multiple (usually)

**Air-Fluid Levels:** Present in 30-40% of cavitary lesions

**Shape:**
- **Round or ovoid**
- **Wedge-shaped** (if peripheral infarct)

**Location:**
- **Peripheral/subpleural** (70-80%)
- **Lower lobes > upper lobes**
- **Bilateral** (90%)

**Key Point:** **Variable appearance** (thin or thick-walled, with or without air-fluid levels)

---

## CT FINDINGS

**Mnemonic: "CAVITARY SEPTIC"**

**C**avitation (30-50% of emboli)
**A**ir-fluid levels (30-40% of cavities)
**V**ariable wall thickness (thin or thick)
**I**nfarction (wedge-shaped peripheral)
**T**iming (1-2 weeks to develop)
**A**bscess formation (thick-walled)
**R**ound or wedge-shaped
**Y**ields air (communication with bronchus)

**S**ubpleural (peripheral location)
**E**mbolus source (endocarditis, IVDU)
**P**eripheral nodules (multiple, bilateral)
**T**hin or thick walls (variable)
**I**rregular inner lining (necrotic debris)
**C**ommunicates with bronchus (air enters)

**Key Point:** **Multiple cavitary peripheral nodules = septic emboli**

---

## THIN-WALLED vs THICK-WALLED CAVITIES

**Thin-Walled (<4mm):**
- **Early cavitation** (1-2 weeks)
- **Rapid liquefaction**
- **Resembles pneumatocele**
- **Better prognosis** (resolves faster with antibiotics)

**Thick-Walled (>4mm):**
- **Abscess formation** (>2 weeks)
- **Organized necrosis**
- **Air-fluid level often present**
- **Slower resolution** (may take months)

**Key Point:** **Thin-walled = early, rapid resolution | Thick-walled = abscess, slower resolution**

---

## SOURCES & ORGANISMS

**Sources (Same as Non-Cavitary):**
1. **IVDU with tricuspid endocarditis** (most common in young adults)
2. **Native valve endocarditis** (mitral, aortic)
3. **Infected central venous catheter**
4. **Septic thrombophlebitis** (Lemierre's syndrome)
5. **Pacemaker/ICD lead infection**

**Organisms:**
- ***Staphylococcus aureus*** (60-80%) - **most common**
- ***Streptococcus*** species (10-15%)
- ***Fusobacterium necrophorum*** (Lemierre's syndrome)
- ***Pseudomonas aeruginosa*** (IVDU, immunocompromised)
- **Polymicrobial** (5-10%)

**Key Point:** **S. aureus = most common** (especially IVDU)

---

## CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF CAVITATION

**Implications:**

1. **Confirms septic emboli** (not bland emboli)
2. **Indicates bacterial infection** (not sterile infarction)
3. **Abscess formation** (if thick-walled)
4. **Longer treatment duration** may be needed
5. **Higher risk of complications** (empyema, hemoptysis)

**Key Point:** **Cavitation = bacterial infection + abscess formation**

---

## COMPLICATIONS

**Mnemonic: "CAVITY RISKS"**

**C**avitation (30-50%)
**A**bscess formation (thick-walled)
**V**asculature involved (hemoptysis risk)
**I**nfection spreads (empyema if rupture)
**T**ension pneumothorax (if rupture)
**Y**ielding air into pleura (pyopneumothorax)

**R**upture into pleura (pneumothorax, empyema)
**I**nvasion of vessels (hemoptysis)
**S**econdary infection (superinfection)
**K**ill rate (mortality 10-20%)
**S**eptic shock (bacteremia)

**Key Point:** **Hemoptysis, pneumothorax, empyema** = major complications

---

## DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF CAVITARY NODULES

**Mnemonic: "CAVITY" (same as other cavitary lesions)**

**C**ancer (squamous cell most common)
**A**spergillosis, lung abscess, septic emboli
**V**asculitis (GPA/Wegener's)
**I**nfection (TB, Nocardia, fungi, Staph, septic emboli)
**T**hromboembolic (septic emboli)
**Y**outh (congenital - sequestration, cysts)

**Key Distinguishing Features:**
- **Multiple peripheral nodules** = septic emboli
- **Feeding vessel sign** = septic emboli
- **Clinical context** (IVDU, endocarditis, fever, positive blood cultures)

**Key Point:** **Multiple peripheral cavitary nodules + clinical context = septic emboli**

---

## TREATMENT

**Antibiotics:**
- **Empiric:** Vancomycin 15-20 mg/kg IV q8-12h + ceftriaxone 2g IV daily
- **Targeted:** Based on blood culture susceptibilities
- **Duration:** 4-6 weeks IV (endocarditis)

**Drainage:**
- **Rarely needed** (antibiotics usually sufficient)
- **Consider if:**
  - Abscess >5cm
  - Not responding to antibiotics
  - Empyema develops (rupture into pleura)

**Source Control:**
- **Remove infected catheter**
- **Valve replacement** (if indicated)
- **Drain source abscess** (if present)

**Key Point:** **Prolonged IV antibiotics usually sufficient** (drainage rarely needed)

---

## IMAGING FOLLOW-UP

**Resolution Timeline:**
- **Thin-walled cavities:** 4-8 weeks
- **Thick-walled cavities:** 8-16 weeks
- **May leave residual scars** or thin-walled cysts

**Repeat Imaging:**
- **Not routinely needed** if clinically improving
- **Follow-up CXR at 6-8 weeks** (ensure resolution)
- **CT if not improving** or worsening

**Key Point:** **Cavities resolve slowly** (2-4 months) but eventually resolve with antibiotics

---

## PROGNOSIS

**Overall:**
- **Mortality 10-20%** (endocarditis-related)
- **Right-sided endocarditis** (IVDU) = better prognosis
- **Left-sided endocarditis** = worse prognosis

**Lung-Specific:**
- **Cavitary emboli resolve** with antibiotics (weeks to months)
- **Rarely progress** to chronic abscesses if adequately treated
- **Hemoptysis risk** (<5%)
- **Empyema risk** (5-10% if rupture)

**Factors Predicting Good Outcome:**
- **Early diagnosis**
- **Appropriate antibiotics**
- **Source control** (remove catheter, valve replacement if needed)
- **Right-sided endocarditis** (vs left-sided)

**Key Point:** **Cavitary septic emboli resolve with prolonged antibiotics** (4-6 weeks)

---
