## Echinococcal Cyst (Hydatid Cyst)

**Q:** What are the characteristic imaging features of echinococcal (hydatid) cyst on CT/MRI including WHO classification, and what are the treatment options?

**A:**

## DEFINITION

**Echinococcal Cyst (Hydatid Cyst):** **"Parasitic cyst caused by *Echinococcus granulosus* or *E. multilocularis*"**

**CT/MRI Hallmark:** **Cystic lesion with daughter cysts, calcified wall, or "water lily sign"**

**Key Point:** **Echinococcal cyst = fluid-filled cyst with daughter cysts** (pathognomonic)

---

## EPIDEMIOLOGY

**Geographic Distribution:**
- **Endemic:** Mediterranean, Middle East, South America, Australia, New Zealand, Central Asia, Africa
- **Sheep-raising areas** (pastoral regions)

**Species:**
- ***Echinococcus granulosus*** (cystic echinococcosis - most common)
- ***Echinococcus multilocularis*** (alveolar echinococcosis - more aggressive, rare)

**Transmission:**
- **Definitive host:** Dogs (harbor adult tapeworm in intestine)
- **Intermediate host:** Sheep, cattle, goats (harbor larval cysts in organs)
- **Human infection:** Accidental intermediate host (ingests eggs from dog feces)

**Key Point:** **Endemic sheep-raising areas** | **Dogs = definitive host** | **Humans = accidental intermediate host**

---

## LIFE CYCLE

**Mnemonic: "DOG-EGG-LIVER-CYST"**

1. **Dog** (definitive host) sheds eggs in feces
2. **Egg** ingested by sheep/cattle (or humans - accidental)
3. **Larva** (oncosphere) penetrates intestinal wall
4. **Portal circulation** → liver (70% localize to liver)
5. **Cyst** forms (hydatid cyst - slow-growing over years)
6. **Sheep eaten by dog** → cycle continues (humans = dead-end host)

**Key Point:** **Humans = dead-end host** (cannot transmit to dogs)

---

## ORGAN INVOLVEMENT

**Most Common Sites:**

1. **Liver** (70% - most common)
2. **Lung** (20%)
3. **Kidney** (3%)
4. **Spleen** (2%)
5. **Brain, bone, heart** (<5%)

**Key Point:** **Liver = 70%** | **Lung = 20%** (combined 90%)

---

## CT FINDINGS (Gold Standard for Liver)

**CT = Preferred Modality for Liver Cysts**

**Hallmark: Cystic Lesion with Daughter Cysts, Calcified Wall, or Internal Membranes**

---

### **CT WITH CONTRAST FINDINGS:**

**Mnemonic: "WATER-LILY-DAUGHTER-CALCIFIED"**

**Water Lily Sign:**
- **Detached endocyst** (inner germinal layer) floating within cyst
- **Undulating membranes** (wavy, serpentine)
- **Pathognomonic** for echinococcal cyst
- **Indicates:** Cyst degeneration (endocyst detaches from pericyst)

**W**avy membranes (undulating)
**A**ttached or detached endocyst
**T**ypical sign (pathognomonic)
**E**ndocyst floating
**R**upture of inner layer

**L**ayer detached (endocyst)
**I**nternal membranes (serpentine)
**L**ucent fluid (hypodense)
**Y**ielding undulating appearance

**Daughter Cysts (HALLMARK - Most Specific):**
- **Multiple small cysts** within larger parent cyst
- **"Cyst within cyst"** appearance
- **Peripheral location** (around rim of parent cyst)
- **Pathognomonic** for echinococcal cyst
- **Indicates:** WHO Type CE2 or CE3 (active cyst)

**D**aughter cysts (hallmark, pathognomonic)
**A**round periphery (rim)
**U**sually multiple
**G**erminal layer (produces daughters)
**H**yperintense on T2 (fluid-filled)
**T**ypical finding (specific)
**E**ndo cyst vesicles
**R**im distribution

**Calcified Wall:**
- **Partial or complete calcification** (eggshell, rim, or linear)
- **Indicates:** Chronic, inactive cyst (WHO Type CE4 or CE5)
- **Calcified cyst = inactive** (dead parasite)

**C**alcification (rim, eggshell, linear)
**A**rc-like (curvilinear)
**L**inear or nodular
**C**hronic cyst (inactive)
**I**ndicates dead parasite
**F**ully calcified (eggshell)
**I**nactive cyst (CE4 or CE5)
**E**ggshell calcification
**D**ead parasite

**Additional Findings:**
- **Simple cyst appearance** (CE1 - early, unilocular, no daughters)
- **Wall enhancement** (pericyst may enhance - host reaction)
- **Pericy stic edema** (if rupture or leak - hypodense halo)
- **Biliary communication** (if ruptures into bile duct - daughter cysts in bile ducts)

**Key Point:** **Daughter cysts = pathognomonic** (most specific sign) | **Water lily sign = pathognomonic**

---

### **WHO CLASSIFICATION (ULTRASOUND/CT):**

**Mnemonic: "CE1-SIMPLE-CE2-DAUGHTER-CE3-DETACHED-CE4-HETEROGENEOUS-CE5-CALCIFIED"**

**CE1 (Active, Simple Cyst):**
- **Unilocular** cyst (no daughters)
- **Anechoic** (simple fluid)
- **No wall calcification**
- **Early stage** (young cyst)

**CE2 (Active, Daughter Cysts):**
- **Daughter cysts present** (pathognomonic)
- **"Rosette" or "honeycomb"** appearance (multiple daughters)
- **Active stage** (fertile cyst)

**CE3 (Transitional, Detached Membranes):**
- **Detached endocyst** (water lily sign)
- **Floating membranes**
- **Transitional** (between active and inactive)

**CE4 (Inactive, Heterogeneous):**
- **Heterogeneous internal echoes** (degenerated cyst contents)
- **Solid-appearing** (no clear fluid)
- **No daughter cysts**
- **Inactive** (dying cyst)

**CE5 (Inactive, Calcified):**
- **Calcified wall** (partial or complete - eggshell)
- **Inactive** (dead cyst)
- **No treatment needed** (observation)

**Key Point:** **CE1-CE3 = active** (may need treatment) | **CE4-CE5 = inactive** (observation or minimal intervention)

---

## MRI FINDINGS

**MRI Characteristics:**

**T1:**
- **Hypointense cyst** (fluid)
- **Daughter cysts:** Hypointense (fluid-filled)
- **Wall:** Variable (low signal if calcified)

**T2:**
- **Hyperintense cyst** (very bright - fluid)
- **Daughter cysts:** Hyperintense (bright - pathognomonic "cyst within cyst")
- **Detached endocyst:** Hypointense serpentine lines (water lily sign)
- **Wall:** Hypointense (fibrous capsule)

**Post-contrast T1:**
- **Rim enhancement** (pericyst - host reaction)
- **Daughter cysts do NOT enhance** (fluid-filled)

**DWI/ADC:**
- **DWI variable** (facilitated diffusion - fluid-filled cyst)
- **ADC high** (bright - fluid)
- **NOT restricted** (vs abscess restricts)

**Key Point:** **MRI excellent for characterizing daughter cysts** (T2 hyperintense cysts within cyst)

---

## ULTRASOUND FINDINGS

**Ultrasound = First-Line Screening (Endemic Areas):**

**Findings:**
- **Simple cyst** (CE1 - anechoic, thin wall)
- **Daughter cysts** (CE2 - multiple small cysts within parent - pathognomonic)
- **Water lily sign** (CE3 - floating membranes)
- **Heterogeneous internal echoes** (CE4 - solid-appearing)
- **Calcified wall** (CE5 - posterior acoustic shadowing)

**Key Point:** **US excellent for screening** (widely available, no radiation, WHO classification)

---

## SEROLOGY

**Antibody Tests:**
- **ELISA** (*Echinococcus* IgG)
- **Indirect hemagglutination** (IHA)
- **Sensitivity:** 80-90% (false-negative if cyst inactive or calcified)

**Complement Fixation:**
- **Less sensitive** (50-70%)

**Limitations:**
- **Cross-reactivity** with other helminths (Taenia, Schistosoma)
- **False-negative** if cyst inactive (CE4-CE5)

**Key Point:** **Serology 80-90% sensitive** (supports diagnosis if positive, but negative doesn't exclude)

---

## CLINICAL PRESENTATION

**Asymptomatic (50-70%):**
- **Discovered incidentally** on imaging (ultrasound, CT)

**Symptomatic (30-50%):**
- **Mass effect:**
  - **Liver:** RUQ pain, hepatomegaly, obstructive jaundice (if bile duct compression)
  - **Lung:** Cough, chest pain, hemoptysis
  - **Brain:** Seizures, focal deficit, increased ICP
- **Cyst rupture/leak:**
  - **Anaphylaxis** (severe, life-threatening - 10-20% if rupture)
  - **Peritonitis** (if ruptures into peritoneum)
  - **Biliary obstruction** (if daughter cysts into bile ducts)
  - **Empyema** (if ruptures into pleura)

**Key Point:** **Rupture → anaphylaxis** (cyst fluid = highly antigenic - life-threatening reaction)

---

## COMPLICATIONS

**Mnemonic: "RUPTURE-ANAPHYLAXIS-SECONDARY-CYSTS"**

**R**upture (into peritoneum, bile ducts, pleura - 10-30%)
**U**rtication (anaphylaxis - if cyst fluid leaks)

**U**ncontrolled anaphylaxis (10-20% if rupture - life-threatening)
**R**ecurrence (after incomplete resection)
**E**xtension (to adjacent organs)

**A**naphylaxis (10-20% if rupture - cyst fluid highly antigenic)
**N**ew cysts (secondary echinococcosis - if cyst ruptures, protoscoleces seed new sites)
**A**djacent organ involvement (bile ducts, bronchus)
**P**eritoneal seeding (if rupture → multiple peritoneal cysts)
**H**epatic failure (if massive liver involvement)
**Y**ielding to shock (anaphylactic)

**Y**ielding to complications
**S**eeding (if rupture)
**T**ransmural rupture (into bile ducts, bronchus)
**S**uperinfection (bacterial abscess within cyst)

**Key Point:** **Rupture → anaphylaxis (10-20%)** | **Secondary cysts (peritoneal seeding)**

---

## DIAGNOSIS

**Imaging:**
- **Ultrasound** (first-line screening - WHO classification)
- **CT with contrast** (best for liver cysts - daughter cysts, calcification)
- **MRI** (excellent characterization, no radiation)
- **CXR** (if lung involvement - round cyst, water lily sign)

**Serology:**
- **ELISA** (*Echinococcus* IgG - 80-90% sensitive)
- **Supports diagnosis** (but negative doesn't exclude)

**Biopsy:**
- **CONTRAINDICATED** (risk of anaphylaxis and peritoneal seeding)
- **Diagnosis is clinical + imaging + serology**

**Key Point:** **NEVER biopsy** (risk of anaphylaxis and seeding) | **Diagnosis = imaging + serology**

---

## TREATMENT

**Treatment Depends on WHO Classification (CE1-CE5):**

---

### **OBSERVATION (No Treatment):**

**Indications:**
- **CE4-CE5** (inactive, calcified cysts)
- **Asymptomatic small cysts** (<5 cm, CE1)

**Monitoring:** Repeat imaging q6-12 months

---

### **ALBENDAZOLE (Medical Therapy):**

**Indications:**
- **CE1** (small, simple cysts <5 cm)
- **CE3a** (detached membranes, transitional)
- **Multiple small cysts** (inoperable)
- **Adjunct to surgery or PAIR** (reduce recurrence)

**Dosing:**
- **Albendazole** 10-15 mg/kg/day divided bid (max 800mg/day) x 3-6 months
- **Cycles:** 28 days on, 14 days off (repeat 3-6 cycles)

**Efficacy:** 30-50% cure (alone), 70-80% with PAIR

**Side Effects:**
- **Hepatotoxicity** (monitor LFTs monthly)
- **Bone marrow suppression** (monitor CBC)

**Key Point:** **Albendazole = adjunct** (not curative alone, 30-50% cure) | **Best for small CE1 cysts**

---

### **PAIR (Percutaneous Aspiration, Injection, Re-aspiration):**

**Indications:**
- **CE1** (unilocular cysts >5 cm)
- **CE3a** (transitional cysts)
- **Inoperable patients** (comorbidities)

**Contraindications:**
- **CE2** (daughter cysts - risk of seeding)
- **Superficial cysts** (risk of spillage)
- **Biliary communication** (risk of biliary obstruction)
- **Calcified cysts** (CE5 - needle cannot penetrate)

**Procedure:**
1. **Aspiration** (remove cyst fluid)
2. **Injection** (hypertonic saline or 95% ethanol - scolicidal)
3. **Re-aspiration** (remove scolicidal agent)

**Perioperative:**
- **Albendazole** (start 7 days before, continue 1-3 months after)
- **Anaphylaxis prophylaxis** (antihistamines, steroids)

**Efficacy:** 70-80% cure (with albendazole)

**Complications:**
- **Anaphylaxis** (5-10%)
- **Peritoneal seeding** (<2% - if spillage)
- **Infection** (bacterial superinfection)

**Key Point:** **PAIR = percutaneous treatment** (70-80% cure with albendazole) | **Contraindicated if CE2 (daughters)**

---

### **SURGERY (Definitive):**

**Indications:**
- **CE2** (daughter cysts - PAIR contraindicated)
- **Large cysts** (>10 cm)
- **Complicated cysts** (rupture, infection, biliary communication)
- **Failed PAIR** (persistent cyst)
- **Superficial cysts** (risk of rupture)

**Procedures:**
1. **Open cystectomy** (remove cyst with pericyst - preferred)
2. **Laparoscopic cystectomy** (selected cases)
3. **Hepatectomy** (if extensive liver involvement)

**Perioperative:**
- **Albendazole** (start 7 days before, continue 1-3 months after)
- **Scolicidal irrigation** (hypertonic saline, 95% ethanol - during surgery)
- **Anaphylaxis prophylaxis**

**Efficacy:** 90-95% cure

**Complications:**
- **Bile leak** (5-10%)
- **Abscess** (superinfection)
- **Recurrence** (5-10% if spillage)

**Key Point:** **Surgery = definitive treatment** (90-95% cure) | **Indicated for CE2 (daughters), large cysts, complications**

---

## PROGNOSIS

**With Treatment:**
- **Surgery:** 90-95% cure
- **PAIR + albendazole:** 70-80% cure
- **Albendazole alone:** 30-50% cure

**Without Treatment:**
- **Slow growth** (years to decades)
- **Complications:** Rupture, anaphylaxis, secondary cysts

**Recurrence:**
- **After surgery:** 5-10% (if spillage, incomplete resection)
- **After PAIR:** 10-20%

**Key Point:** **Surgery = best cure rate** (90-95%) | **PAIR = good alternative** (70-80% with albendazole)

---

## DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

**Other Hepatic Cystic Lesions:**

**Mnemonic: "ECHINOCOCCAL-SIMPLE-ABSCESS-CYSTADENOMA"**

**Echinococcal Cyst:**
- **Daughter cysts** + calcified wall + water lily sign + serology positive

**Simple Hepatic Cyst:**
- **Unilocular** (no daughters)
- **Thin smooth wall** (no calcification)
- **No enhancement**

**Pyogenic Abscess:**
- **Rim enhancement** + restricted diffusion + fever + leukocytosis
- **No daughter cysts**

**Cystadenoma/Cystadenocarcinoma:**
- **Multilocular** (septations)
- **Enhancing septations** (vs echinococcal daughters don't enhance)
- **Solid component** (if cystadenocarcinoma)

**Polycystic Liver Disease:**
- **Multiple cysts** (dozens to hundreds)
- **Bilateral** kidneys also affected (ADPKD)
- **No daughter cysts**

**Key Point:** **Daughter cysts + calcified wall = echinococcal** (pathognomonic)

---

**Clinical Pearls:**
- **Echinococcal cyst = daughter cysts** (pathognomonic, "cyst within cyst")
- **Water lily sign = detached endocyst** (floating membranes - pathognomonic)
- **Liver = 70%** | **Lung = 20%** (combined 90%)
- **Endemic sheep-raising areas** (Mediterranean, Middle East, South America)
- **Dogs = definitive host** | **Humans = dead-end host**
- **WHO CE1-CE3 = active** (may need treatment) | **CE4-CE5 = inactive** (observation)
- **NEVER biopsy** (risk of anaphylaxis and peritoneal seeding)
- **Diagnosis = imaging + serology** (ELISA 80-90% sensitive)
- **Rupture → anaphylaxis (10-20%)** + secondary cysts (peritoneal seeding)
- **Treatment options:**
  - **Observation** (CE4-CE5 inactive)
  - **Albendazole** (CE1 small, adjunct to PAIR/surgery)
  - **PAIR** (CE1 >5cm, CE3a - 70-80% cure with albendazole)
  - **Surgery** (CE2 daughters, large, complications - 90-95% cure)
- **Surgery = best cure rate** (90-95%)
- **PAIR contraindicated if CE2** (daughter cysts - risk of seeding)
