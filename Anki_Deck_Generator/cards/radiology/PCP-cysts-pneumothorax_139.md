## PCP - Cysts and Pneumothorax

**Q:** What are the characteristics of cystic PCP on CT, and why do these cysts predispose to spontaneous pneumothorax?

**A:**

## CYSTIC PCP DEFINITION

**Cystic PCP:** Thin-walled air-filled cysts that develop in 10-35% of PCP cases, strongly associated with pneumothorax risk.

**Key Point:** **Cysts in PCP = 35% pneumothorax risk** (vs 6% without cysts)

---

## CT CHARACTERISTICS OF PCP CYSTS

### **Mnemonic: "THIN UPPER CYSTS"**

**T**hin-walled (<2mm wall thickness)
**H**IV patients (CD4 <200)
**I**ncreased pneumothorax risk (35% if cysts present)
**N**umerous (usually >20 cysts)

**U**pper lobe predominance (>lower lobes)
**P**ersist or develop during treatment
**P**neumatoceles (air-filled cysts)
**E**nlarged progressively (may worsen with treatment)
**R**ound or ovoid shape (2-10mm diameter)

**C**ysts appear during immune recovery
**Y**ield to rupture (spontaneous PTX)
**S**ubpleural location (highest rupture risk)
**T**reatment-related (may develop on therapy)
**S**mall to large (2mm to 10cm range)

---

## CYST CHARACTERISTICS

**Size:** 2mm to 10cm (most 5-20mm)
**Number:** Multiple (typically >20)
**Location:** 
- **Upper lobes > lower lobes** (60-70% upper lobe predominance)
- **Subpleural** (highest rupture risk)
**Wall thickness:** Very thin (<2mm, often <1mm)
**Shape:** Round or ovoid
**Distribution:** Bilateral, random

**Key Point:** **Subpleural + thin-walled + upper lobe = high PTX risk**

---

## TEMPORAL EVOLUTION

**Mnemonic: "BEFORE-DURING-AFTER"**

### **BEFORE Treatment:**
- **Ground-glass opacities predominate**
- **Few or no cysts** (10-15% have cysts at presentation)

### **DURING Treatment:**
- **Cysts develop or enlarge** (immune reconstitution)
- **Peak cyst formation: Week 2-4 of treatment**
- **Ground-glass opacities improve**
- **Highest PTX risk period**

### **AFTER Treatment:**
- **Cysts may persist for months to years**
- **Slow resolution** (6-12 months)
- **Some cysts never resolve**

**Key Point:** **Cysts develop during treatment** (immune reconstitution) = highest PTX risk

---

## PNEUMOTHORAX IN PCP

**Incidence:**
- **Overall PCP: 6%**
- **PCP with cysts: 35%** (6-fold increased risk)
- **Most common during treatment** (week 1-4)

**Characteristics:**
- **Spontaneous** (no trauma)
- **Often bilateral** (25-40% of PTX cases)
- **Recurrent** (20-30% recurrence rate)
- **Refractory to chest tube** (persistent air leak)
- **Associated with high mortality** (30-40% if on mechanical ventilation)

**Key Point:** **Bilateral PTX + HIV + recent PCP diagnosis = cystic PCP complication**

---

## PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF PTX IN PCP

**Mechanism:**

1. **Alveolar inflammation** → alveolar wall damage
2. **Check-valve obstruction** → air trapping
3. **Cyst formation** (pneumatocele)
4. **Subpleural cyst rupture** → air enters pleural space
5. **Pneumothorax**

**Why Refractory to Treatment:**
- **Multiple cysts** (one rupture heals, another ruptures)
- **Persistent inflammation** (ongoing lung damage)
- **Positive pressure ventilation** (if intubated - worsens air leak)

**Key Point:** **Persistent air leak common** (multiple cysts rupturing sequentially)

---

## RISK FACTORS FOR PTX IN PCP

**Mnemonic: "CYST-RISK"**

**C**ysts present (>20 cysts = highest risk)
**Y**oung age (<40 years)
**S**moking history (damages lungs)
**T**reatment initiation (week 1-4 = peak)

**R**ibavirin or pentamidine (inhalational - increases risk)
**I**mmune reconstitution (starting ART during PCP treatment)
**S**ubpleural cyst location
**K**nown prior PTX (recurrence risk 20-30%)

**Key Point:** **Starting ART during PCP treatment = immune reconstitution → increased PTX risk**

---

## MANAGEMENT OF PTX IN PCP

### **Small PTX (<20%, stable):**
- **Observation** (if no respiratory distress)
- **Supplemental oxygen**
- **Serial CXR monitoring**

### **Large PTX (>20% or symptomatic):**
- **Chest tube** (20-28 Fr)
- **Continue PCP treatment** (do NOT stop)
- **High-flow oxygen** (if needed)

### **Refractory PTX (persistent air leak >7 days):**
- **Chemical pleurodesis** (talc, doxycycline)
- **VATS pleurodesis** (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery)
- **Thoracotomy with pleural abrasion** (if VATS fails)

### **Bilateral PTX:**
- **Bilateral chest tubes**
- **Avoid positive pressure ventilation** if possible (worsens air leak)
- **Consider early surgical intervention** (if refractory)

**Key Point:** **Continue PCP treatment despite PTX** (stopping treatment worsens mortality)

---

## MECHANICAL VENTILATION CAUTION

**Problem:** Positive pressure ventilation **increases PTX risk** and **worsens air leak**

**Strategy:**
- **Avoid intubation if possible** (high-flow nasal cannula, BiPAP)
- **Lung-protective ventilation** if intubated:
  - Low tidal volumes (4-6 mL/kg ideal body weight)
  - Low plateau pressures (<30 cmH₂O)
  - Permissive hypercapnia
- **Chest tube before intubation** (if PTX present)

**Mortality:** **50-90% if intubated with PTX** (very high mortality)

**Key Point:** **Avoid intubation if possible** in PCP with cysts/PTX (very high mortality)

---

## PROGNOSIS

**PTX in PCP:**
- **Mortality: 30-40%** (especially if mechanically ventilated)
- **Recurrence: 20-30%** (even after pleurodesis)
- **Prolonged hospitalization** (persistent air leak)

**Cysts Without PTX:**
- **Good prognosis** (if no rupture)
- **Slow resolution** (months to years)
- **May persist indefinitely**

**Key Point:** **PTX in PCP = poor prognosis** (30-40% mortality, especially if ventilated)

---

## DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF CYSTIC LUNG DISEASE

**Mnemonic: "CYSTIC LUNGS"**

**C**ystic PCP (HIV, thin-walled, upper lobes)
**Y**outh (congenital - bronchogenic cysts, CPAM)
**S**moking-related (emphysema, Langerhans cell histiocytosis)
**T**B (cavitation, thick-walled)
**I**nfection (Staph aureus pneumatoceles, post-viral)
**C**ystic fibrosis (bronchiectasis, mucus plugging)

**L**ymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM - premenopausal women)
**U**sual interstitial pneumonia (honeycombing, basal)
**N**ecrotic nodules (metastases, septic emboli)
**G**ranulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA/Wegener's)
**S**arcoidosis (rare cystic variant)

**Key Point:** **HIV + multiple thin-walled upper lobe cysts = cystic PCP**

---

## PREVENTION

**PCP Prophylaxis (prevents cysts):**
- **TMP-SMX** (Bactrim DS 1 tab daily or 1 DS tab 3x/week)
- **Indications:** CD4 <200, prior PCP, CD4 <14%, oral thrush

**PTX Prevention (if cysts present):**
- **Avoid smoking** (damages lungs further)
- **Avoid high altitude** (lower atmospheric pressure)
- **Avoid scuba diving** (barotrauma)
- **Consider early pleurodesis** (if recurrent PTX)

**Key Point:** **TMP-SMX prophylaxis prevents PCP** (and thus prevents cystic PCP/PTX)

---

**Clinical Pearls:**
- **Cysts develop in 10-35% of PCP cases** (especially during treatment)
- **Thin-walled (<2mm), upper lobe predominant, multiple (>20)**
- **Pneumothorax risk: 35% if cysts present** (vs 6% without cysts)
- **PTX occurs during treatment** (week 1-4, immune reconstitution)
- **Often bilateral** (25-40%), refractory to chest tube (persistent air leak)
- **Continue PCP treatment despite PTX** (stopping worsens mortality)
- **Avoid intubation if possible** (50-90% mortality if mechanically ventilated with PTX)
- **Chemical or surgical pleurodesis** if persistent air leak >7 days
- **Cysts may persist for months to years** after PCP treatment
- **Starting ART during PCP = immune reconstitution** → increased PTX risk
- **Mortality 30-40% if PTX develops** (especially if ventilated)
- **Prevention: TMP-SMX prophylaxis** if CD4 <200

**Media:**

**Image 1 - Cystic PCP (Multiple Thin-Walled Cysts):**

*CT chest showing multiple thin-walled cysts (<2mm wall thickness) predominantly in the upper lobes with background ground-glass opacities. Patient is HIV-positive (CD4 60) on day 10 of PCP treatment. Cysts developed during treatment (immune reconstitution). High risk for pneumothorax.*

**Image 2 - PCP with Pneumothorax:**

*Chest X-ray showing bilateral pneumothoraces (arrows) in HIV patient being treated for PCP. Note bilateral chest tubes in place. Patient had cystic PCP on prior CT (>30 cysts). Developed bilateral PTX on day 14 of treatment despite appropriate therapy. Required prolonged hospitalization due to persistent air leak.*

**Image 3 - Evolution of Cystic PCP:**

*Serial CT images showing temporal evolution: (A) Presentation - diffuse ground-glass opacities, few cysts. (B) Week 2 of treatment - ground-glass improving, multiple new cysts appearing (immune reconstitution). (C) Week 6 - ground-glass resolved, cysts persist. (D) 6 months post-treatment - slow resolution of cysts.*
