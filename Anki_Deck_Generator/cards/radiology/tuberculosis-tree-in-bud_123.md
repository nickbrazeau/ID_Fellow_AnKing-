## Tuberculosis - Tree-in-Bud Pattern (Chest CT)

**Q:** What is the tree-in-bud pattern on chest CT, what does it represent pathophysiologically in tuberculosis, and what are the key differential diagnoses to consider?

**A:**

## DEFINITION

**Tree-in-bud Pattern:**

**"Centrilobular micronodules (2-4mm) with linear branching pattern resembling a budding tree"**

**CT Characteristics:**
- **Size:** 2-4mm diameter nodules
- **Location:** Centrilobular (within 5mm of pleural surface)
- **Pattern:** Linear branching opacities with nodular tips
- **Best seen on:** High-resolution CT (HRCT), maximum intensity projection (MIP)

**Key Point:** **Tree-in-bud = centrilobular nodules + branching linear opacities**

---

## PATHOPHYSIOLOGY IN TUBERCULOSIS

**Mechanism: Endobronchial Spread of Infection**

**Anatomic Basis:**
- **Small airways** (terminal bronchioles) filled with **purulent/caseous material**
- **Bronchiolar wall thickening** and inflammation
- **Mucus plugging** with dilated bronchioles (bronchiolectasis)
- **Bronchovascular interstitial infiltration**

**Sequence of Events:**
1. **Cavitation develops** in post-primary TB (upper lobes)
2. **Cavity communicates with airways**
3. **AFB-containing material spreads endobronchially**
4. **Small airways become infected** → tree-in-bud appearance

**Key Point:** **Tree-in-bud in TB = active endobronchial dissemination = contagious**

---

## CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE IN TB

**Tree-in-bud Pattern Indicates:**

1. **Active infection** with endobronchial spread
2. **High bacillary burden** (AFB smear likely positive)
3. **Increased infectivity** (respiratory isolation required)
4. **Cavitation likely present** (source of endobronchial spread)
5. **Treatment-responsive finding** (should resolve with therapy)

**Key Point:** **Tree-in-bud + upper lobe cavitation = active TB until proven otherwise**

---

## DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF TREE-IN-BUD PATTERN

### **Mnemonic: "TREE BUDS"**

**T**uberculosis (and NTM - MAC, *M. kansasii*)
**R**espiratory infections (bacterial bronchiolitis)
**E**ndobronchial spread (aspiration, bronchiectasis)
**E**xogenous lipoid pneumonia (aspiration)

**B**ronchiectasis (CF, ciliary dyskinesia)
**U**sual suspects (Staph, H. flu, viral)
**D**iffuse panbronchiolitis
**S**mall airway disease (obliterative bronchiolitis, ABPA)

---

### **Infectious Causes:**

| **Category** | **Pathogens** | **Key Features** |
|--------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Mycobacterial** | **TB, MAC, M. kansasii** | Upper lobe, cavitation, immunocompromised |
| **Bacterial** | **Staph aureus, H. influenzae, Pseudomonas** | CF, bronchiectasis, nosocomial |
| **Viral** | Respiratory viruses (RSV, adenovirus) | Pediatric, diffuse distribution |
| **Fungal** | **Aspergillus (ABPA)**, PCP | Asthma/CF (ABPA), HIV (PCP) |

**Key Point:** **Mycobacterial infections (TB, MAC) most commonly cause tree-in-bud with upper lobe involvement**

---

### **Non-Infectious Causes:**

| **Category** | **Conditions** | **Key Features** |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Congenital** | **Cystic fibrosis**, ciliary dyskinesia | Bronchiectasis, recurrent infections |
| **Inflammatory** | Rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's | Systemic symptoms, autoantibodies |
| **Bronchial** | **Obliterative bronchiolitis**, panbronchiolitis | Post-transplant, Asian ethnicity (panbronchiolitis) |
| **Aspiration** | Exogenous lipoid pneumonia | Lower lobe, aspiration history |
| **Neoplastic** | Adenocarcinoma, lymphoma, metastases | Mass lesion, lymphadenopathy |
| **Drug-related** | **Talcosis (IVDU)** | IV drug use, basilar predominance |

**Key Point:** **Lower lobe tree-in-bud suggests aspiration or bronchiectasis** (vs upper lobe = TB/NTM)

---

## TB-SPECIFIC FEATURES

**How to Distinguish TB from Other Causes:**

| **Feature** | **Tuberculosis** | **Other Causes** |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Location** | **Upper lobes (posterior segments)** | Variable (lower lobes if aspiration) |
| **Cavitation** | **Common (20-45%)** | Less common (except Staph, Klebsiella) |
| **Consolidation** | Patchy, surrounding cavity | Variable |
| **Lymphadenopathy** | Hilar/mediastinal (~33%) | Depends on cause |
| **Risk factors** | HIV, immunosuppression, endemic exposure | CF (bronchiectasis), IVDU (Staph) |
| **Sputum AFB** | **Positive (if tree-in-bud present)** | Negative |

**Key Point:** **Upper lobe tree-in-bud + cavitation + AFB+ = TB**

---

## ANATOMIC DISTRIBUTION (CLUE TO ETIOLOGY)

**Location Helps Narrow Differential:**

| **Distribution** | **Most Likely Causes** |
|------------------|------------------------|
| **Upper lobe predominance** | **TB, MAC, NTM** |
| **Lower lobe predominance** | **Aspiration, bronchiectasis** |
| **Diffuse** | Viral pneumonia, panbronchiolitis |
| **Peribronchovascular** | Endobronchial spread (TB, aspiration) |

**Key Point:** **Upper lobe tree-in-bud = think mycobacterial** (TB or MAC)

## IMAGING APPROACH TO TREE-IN-BUD

**When You See Tree-in-Bud, Ask:**

1. **Location?** (Upper vs lower lobes)
2. **Cavitation present?** (Suggests TB, Staph, Klebsiella)
3. **Consolidation?** (Pneumonia vs endobronchial spread)
4. **Lymphadenopathy?** (TB, fungal, neoplastic)
5. **Bronchiectasis?** (CF, chronic infection, NTM)
6. **Patient risk factors?** (HIV, immunosuppression, CF, IVDU)

**Key Point:** **Tree-in-bud + upper lobe + cavitation = TB until proven otherwise**

---

## ASSOCIATED FINDINGS IN TB

**Tree-in-bud Usually Seen WITH:**

- **Cavitation** (thick-walled, upper lobe)
- **Patchy consolidation** (surrounding cavity)
- **Hilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy** (~33%)
- **Pleural effusion** (if active disease)
- **Miliary nodules** (if hematogenous dissemination)

**Key Point:** **Isolated tree-in-bud without cavitation is uncommon in TB** (suggests early infection or NTM)

---

## CLINICAL MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS

**If Tree-in-bud Seen:**

1. **Respiratory isolation** (if TB suspected)
2. **Sputum AFB smear/culture** (3 samples)
3. **NAAT testing** (GeneXpert for MTB/RIF)
4. **Assess for cavitation** (high infectivity risk)
5. **Monitor treatment response** (tree-in-bud should resolve)

**Key Point:** **Tree-in-bud = active infection = high AFB yield on sputum**

---

## RESPONSE TO TREATMENT

**Expected Changes:**

- **Tree-in-bud resolves** within 2-3 months of effective therapy
- **Persistent tree-in-bud after 6 months** → consider:
  - **Drug resistance** (MDR-TB)
  - **Non-adherence**
  - **Alternative diagnosis** (MAC, bronchiectasis)

**Key Point:** **Persistence of tree-in-bud beyond 6 months should prompt re-evaluation**

---

**Clinical Pearls:**
- **Tree-in-bud = 2-4mm centrilobular nodules with branching pattern**
- **In TB, indicates active endobronchial spread = high infectivity**
- **Upper lobe tree-in-bud + cavitation = TB until proven otherwise**
- **Lower lobe tree-in-bud suggests aspiration or bronchiectasis**
- **Tree-in-bud in TB implies AFB-positive sputum** (high bacillary burden)
- **Requires respiratory isolation** (airborne precautions)
- **Should resolve within 2-3 months of effective TB treatment**
- **Differential: TB, MAC, bacterial bronchiolitis, CF, aspiration, ABPA**
- **Best visualized on HRCT with MIP reconstruction**
