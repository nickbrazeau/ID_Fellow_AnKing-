## Coccidioidomycosis - Thin-Walled Cavities (Valley Fever)

**Q:** What are the characteristic CT findings of coccidioidomycosis including thin-walled cavities, nodules, and how to distinguish it from other endemic fungi?

**A:**

## DEFINITION

**Coccidioidomycosis ("Valley Fever"):** Endemic fungal infection caused by ***Coccidioides immitis*** (California) or ***C. posadasii*** (Arizona, Texas).

**Geographic Distribution:** **Southwestern United States** (California, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas), Mexico, Central/South America

**Key Point:** **Coccidioidomycosis = Valley Fever = Southwestern US endemic fungus**

---

## CT FINDINGS

**Hallmark: Thin-Walled Cavities**

### **Mnemonic: "VALLEY FEVER"**

**V**ery thin walls (<3mm) - **HALLMARK**
**A**symptomatic cavities (may be incidental)
**L**ower lobes > upper lobes (unlike TB)
**L**arge cavities (2-10cm, usually solitary)
**E**rythema nodosum (clinical clue)
**Y**ears after infection (cavities persist)

**F**ew or no surrounding infiltrates (well-demarcated)
**E**osinophilia (peripheral blood)
**V**ery round, smooth walls (not irregular)
**E**nlarged hilar lymph nodes (in acute infection)
**R**upture risk (pneumothorax, bronchopleural fistula)

---

## IMAGING PATTERNS

### **1. Thin-Walled Cavities (Most Characteristic):**

**Characteristics:**
- **Very thin walls** (<3mm, often 1-2mm)
- **Round, smooth** (not irregular or shaggy)
- **Solitary** (80%) or multiple (20%)
- **Size:** 2-10cm (large)
- **Location:** Lower lobes > upper lobes (unlike TB)
- **Persist for years** (chronic, often asymptomatic)
- **No surrounding infiltrate** (well-demarcated)

**Key Point:** **Thin-walled cavity (<3mm) + lower lobes + Southwestern US = Coccidioides**

---

### **2. Nodules ("Coccidioidomas"):**

**Characteristics:**
- **Single nodule** or **mass** (1-5cm)
- **Smooth, well-defined margins**
- **May have central calcification** (concentric, laminated)
- **Mimics malignancy** (requires biopsy if uncertain)
- **Represents resolving granuloma**

**Key Point:** **Solitary pulmonary nodule in endemic area = consider coccidioidoma** (vs malignancy)

---

### **3. Acute Pneumonia Pattern:**

**Characteristics:**
- **Patchy consolidation** (segmental or lobar)
- **Hilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy** (bilateral)
- **Pleural effusion** (10-20%)
- **Ground-glass opacities**
- **Resolves over 2-6 weeks** (may leave residual nodule or cavity)

**Key Point:** **Acute pneumonia + hilar LAD + endemic area = Valley Fever**

---

### **4. Miliary Pattern (Disseminated Disease):**

**Characteristics:**
- **Small nodules** (1-3mm, random distribution)
- **Bilateral, diffuse**
- **In immunocompromised** (HIV, transplant, steroids)
- **High mortality** if untreated

**Key Point:** **Miliary pattern + immunocompromised + endemic area = disseminated coccidioidomycosis**

---

## CAVITY CHARACTERISTICS (DISTINGUISHING FEATURES)

| **Feature** | **Coccidioidomycosis** | **Tuberculosis** | **Lung Abscess** |
|-------------|------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Wall thickness** | **Thin (<3mm)** | Thick (>4mm) | Thick (>4mm, irregular) |
| **Location** | **Lower lobes > upper** | **Upper lobes > lower** | Dependent segments |
| **Number** | **Solitary (80%)** | Multiple or single | Usually solitary |
| **Surrounding infiltrate** | **Absent** (well-demarcated) | **Present** (consolidation) | **Present** (consolidation) |
| **Shape** | **Round, smooth** | Irregular | Irregular, shaggy |
| **Air-fluid level** | **Rare** | Common | **Common** |
| **Immune status** | **Immunocompetent** | Immunocompromised > competent | Aspiration risk factors |
| **Geographic** | **Southwestern US** | Endemic areas (global) | Anywhere |

**Key Point:** **Thin wall (<3mm) + lower lobes + no infiltrate = Coccidioides**

---

## CLINICAL PRESENTATION

### **Primary Pulmonary Infection (60% Asymptomatic):**

**Symptomatic Acute Infection (40%):**
- **"Valley Fever" or "Desert Rheumatism"**
- **Fever, dry cough** (2-3 weeks after exposure)
- **Chest pain** (pleuritic)
- **Fatigue, night sweats** (may last weeks)
- **Erythema nodosum** (10-15% - tender red nodules on shins, **associated with good prognosis**)
- **Arthralgia** ("desert rheumatism" - reactive arthritis)

**Key Point:** **Erythema nodosum + acute pneumonia = Valley Fever** (good prognosis, self-limited)

---

### **Chronic Pulmonary Infection:**

**Characteristics:**
- **Persistent cavities** (thin-walled, chronic)
- **Usually asymptomatic** (incidental finding)
- **Coccidioidoma** (residual nodule)
- **Hemoptysis** (if cavity ruptures into vessel - rare)

**Key Point:** **Thin-walled cavity may persist for years** (usually asymptomatic, no treatment needed if stable)

---

### **Disseminated Infection (1-5%):**

**High-Risk Groups:**
- **Immunocompromised** (HIV CD4 <250, transplant, steroids, TNF-α inhibitors)
- **Pregnancy** (especially 3rd trimester)
- **Diabetes**
- **African American or Filipino descent** (genetic susceptibility)

**Sites of Dissemination:**
- **Skin** (papules, nodules, abscesses)
- **Meninges** (coccidioidal meningitis - basilar meningitis, hydrocephalus)
- **Bone/joints** (osteomyelitis, septic arthritis)
- **Miliary pulmonary disease**

**Key Point:** **African American or Filipino + endemic exposure = high risk for dissemination**

---

## DIAGNOSIS

**Serology (Most Common):**
- **IgM antibody** (early infection, appears 1-3 weeks)
- **IgG antibody** (later infection, persists for months to years)
- **Complement fixation titer** (quantitative, >1:16 suggests active infection)
- **Immunodiffusion** (qualitative)

**Antigen Detection:**
- ***Coccidioides* antigen** (urine/serum) - useful in disseminated disease

**Culture:**
- **Respiratory specimens** (sputum, BAL)
- **Tissue biopsy** (if nodule or disseminated disease)
- **BIOHAZARD** - grows rapidly, highly infectious (spherules in tissue)

**Histopathology:**
- **Spherules** (20-200 μm, thick-walled, filled with endospores)
- **GMS or PAS stain**
- **Granulomatous inflammation**

**Key Point:** **Serology = most common diagnostic test** (IgM early, IgG late, complement fixation for monitoring)

---

## DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

**Thin-Walled Cavities:**

**Mnemonic: "THIN CAVITY"**

**T**B (usually thick-walled, upper lobes)
**H**ydatid cyst (echinococcosis - very thin wall, may rupture)
**I**nfection (Coccidioides - **thin-walled, lower lobes**)
**N**eoplasm (squamous cell carcinoma - usually thick-walled)

**C**ongenital (bronchogenic cyst, sequestration)
**A**spergilloma (fungal ball in pre-existing cavity)
**V**asculitis (GPA/Wegener's - usually thick-walled)
**I**nfarct (septic emboli - peripheral wedge-shaped)
**T**raumatic pneumatocele (post-trauma, resolves)
**Y**outh (congenital cysts, sequestration)

**Key Point:** **Thin-walled cavity in endemic area = Coccidioides > hydatid cyst**

---

## COMPLICATIONS

**Mnemonic: "RUPTURE"**

**R**upture into pleural space (empyema, bronchopleural fistula)
**U**nstable cavity (enlarging, symptomatic)
**P**neumothorax (if rupture)
**T**reatment needed (if symptomatic, enlarging)
**U**sually asymptomatic (chronic cavities)
**R**arely hemoptysis (if erodes into vessel)
**E**mpyema (if rupture into pleura)

**Key Point:** **Most thin-walled cavities are asymptomatic** (no treatment needed if stable)

---

## TREATMENT

### **Primary Pulmonary Infection:**

**Mild, Self-Limited:**
- **No treatment** (60% asymptomatic, self-limited in immunocompetent)
- **Observation**

**Symptomatic, Prolonged, or Severe:**
- **Fluconazole** 400mg PO daily x 3-6 months
- **Itraconazole** 200mg PO BID x 3-6 months (alternative)

---

### **Chronic Cavities:**

**Asymptomatic, Stable:**
- **No treatment** (observation)
- **Serial imaging** (ensure stability)

**Symptomatic, Enlarging, or Complicated:**
- **Fluconazole** 400mg PO daily x 12 months
- **Surgical resection** if refractory (empyema, hemoptysis, bronchopleural fistula)

---

### **Disseminated Disease:**

**Non-Meningeal:**
- **Fluconazole** 400-800mg PO daily x 12+ months (may need lifelong if immunocompromised)
- **Amphotericin B** (severe, life-threatening) → step down to fluconazole

**Meningeal (CNS Involvement):**
- **Fluconazole** 800-1200mg PO daily x **lifelong**
- **Intrathecal amphotericin B** (if refractory)
- **Hydrocephalus management** (shunt if needed)

**Key Point:** **Meningeal coccidioidomycosis = lifelong fluconazole** (relapse common if stopped)

---

## PROGNOSIS

**Primary Pulmonary Infection:**
- **Excellent prognosis** (self-limited in immunocompetent)
- **Erythema nodosum = favorable prognosis** (strong immune response)

**Chronic Cavities:**
- **Usually asymptomatic** (no treatment needed)
- **Rupture risk <5%** (empyema, pneumothorax)

**Disseminated Disease:**
- **High mortality if untreated** (30-50%)
- **Improved with treatment** (fluconazole, amphotericin B)
- **Meningeal disease = lifelong treatment** (relapse risk high)

**Key Point:** **Primary infection = excellent prognosis** | **Disseminated = requires prolonged/lifelong treatment**

---

**Clinical Pearls:**
- **Coccidioidomycosis = Valley Fever = Southwestern US endemic fungus**
- **Thin-walled cavities (<3mm) in lower lobes = Coccidioides**
- **Solitary, smooth, round cavity** (no surrounding infiltrate)
- **Most cavities asymptomatic** (persist for years, no treatment needed if stable)
- **Erythema nodosum = favorable prognosis** (strong immune response, self-limited)
- **African American or Filipino descent = high risk for dissemination**
- **Diagnosis: Serology (IgM early, IgG late, complement fixation for monitoring)**
- **Treatment: Fluconazole 400mg daily x 3-6 months (symptomatic primary infection)**
- **Disseminated disease: Fluconazole 12+ months** (may need lifelong if immunocompromised)
- **Meningeal disease: Fluconazole lifelong** (800-1200mg daily)
- **Coccidioidoma = residual nodule** (mimics malignancy, requires biopsy if uncertain)
- **Geographic clue: California, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas**

**Media:**

**Image 1 - Coccidioidomycosis Thin-Walled Cavity:**

*CT chest showing large, thin-walled cavity (wall thickness <2mm) in the left lower lobe. Note the smooth, round margins and absence of surrounding infiltrate. Patient is from Arizona with history of Valley Fever 2 years prior, now asymptomatic. Cavity has remained stable on serial imaging.*

**Image 2 - Coccidioidoma (Residual Nodule):**

*CT showing solitary pulmonary nodule (coccidioidoma) in the right lower lobe with smooth margins and central concentric calcification. This represents a resolving granuloma from prior coccidioidomycosis infection. Mimics malignancy and may require biopsy if no history of Valley Fever.*

**Image 3 - Acute Coccidioidomycosis Pneumonia:**

*CT chest showing patchy consolidation in the right lower lobe with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. Patient presented with fever, cough, and erythema nodosum after visiting Arizona. Serology confirmed acute coccidioidomycosis (IgM positive). Resolved with supportive care in 4 weeks.*
