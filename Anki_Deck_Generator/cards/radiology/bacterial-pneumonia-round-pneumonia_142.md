## Round Pneumonia (Pediatric)

**Q:** What is round pneumonia, why does it occur primarily in children, and how is it distinguished from lung mass on imaging?

**A:**

## DEFINITION

**Round Pneumonia:** **"Focal pneumonia appearing as a round or oval mass-like opacity, predominantly in children"**

**Age:** **Children <8 years** (80-90% of cases)

**Key Point:** **Round mass in child = round pneumonia** (until proven otherwise)

---

## PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

**Why Round in Children:**

1. **Immature collateral ventilation:**
   - **Pores of Kohn** (interalveolar) - underdeveloped in children
   - **Channels of Lambert** (bronchiole-alveolar) - fewer in children
   - **Result:** Infection confined to one area (cannot spread through collateral channels)

2. **Well-developed interlobular septa:**
   - **Lobular anatomy more distinct** in children
   - **Infection respects lobular boundaries** → round appearance

3. **Normal collateral ventilation in adults:**
   - **Infection spreads** through pores/channels → irregular, spreading consolidation
   - **Rare to see round pneumonia in adults**

**Key Point:** **Immature collateral ventilation in children = round pneumonia**

## CT FINDINGS

**Hallmark: Round or Oval Mass-Like Opacity**

### **Mnemonic: "ROUND CHILD"**

**R**ound or oval shape (mass-like)
**O**ften posterior segments (RLL, RUL)
**U**sually children <8 years
**N**o cavitation (unless necrotizing)
**D**ense, homogeneous opacity

**C**hange with antibiotics (resolves in days)
**H**azy margins (not sharp like tumor)
**I**ll-defined borders (vs sharp tumor margins)
**L**ack of enhancement (unlike tumor)
**D**iagnostic: Rapid response to antibiotics

---

## IMAGING CHARACTERISTICS

**CXR:**
- **Round or oval opacity** (2-8cm)
- **Well-defined margins** (mimics mass)
- **Homogeneous density**
- **No calcification** (vs tumor)
- **Air bronchograms** (may be present)
- **Single lesion** (90%), rarely multiple

**CT:**
- **Round consolidation**
- **Hazy margins** on lung windows (not sharp like tumor)
- **Air bronchograms** (confirms airspace disease)
- **No necrosis or cavitation** (unless necrotizing organism)
- **No enhancement** (vs vascular tumor)
- **Rapid resolution with antibiotics** (days to 1-2 weeks)

**Key Point:** **Hazy margins + air bronchograms = pneumonia** (vs sharp tumor margins)

---

## LOCATION

**Most Common:**
1. **Right lower lobe** (posterior segment) - 40-50%
2. **Right upper lobe** (posterior segment) - 20-30%
3. **Left lower lobe** - 15-20%
4. **Right middle lobe** - 5-10%

**Key Point:** **Posterior segments most common** (RLL, RUL posterior)

---

## ORGANISMS

**Same as Typical Pediatric CAP:**

**Mnemonic: "PNEUMO-KIDS"**

**P**neumo (***S. pneumoniae***) - **most common** (60-70%)
**N**ecrotizing if Staph (S. aureus - post-viral)
**E**nteric gram-negatives (rare)
**U**sual bacterial pathogens
**M**ycoplasma (less common in round pneumonia)
**O**ther: H. influenzae

**K**lebsiella (rare in children)
**I**nfluenza predisposition (for S. aureus)
**D**iagnostic challenge (mimics tumor)
**S**trep pneumoniae (most common organism)

**Key Point:** ***S. pneumoniae* = 60-70% of round pneumonia** (same as CAP)

---

## DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

**Mnemonic: "ROUND MASS IN CHILD"**

**R**ound pneumonia (most common)
**O**nco (malignancy - rare in children)
**U**ncommon tumors (neuroblastoma metastases, pleuropulmonary blastoma)
**N**euroblastoma (chest wall mass with lung invasion)
**D**evelopmental (sequestration, bronchogenic cyst)

**M**alignancy (primary lung cancer extremely rare <18 years)
**A**bscess (if cavitation develops)
**S**equestration (congenital, lower lobe)
**S**arcoma (rare)

**I**nfection (round pneumonia, fungal, TB)
**N**odule (granuloma, hamartoma - rare)

**C**ystic lesions (bronchogenic cyst, CPAM)
**H**emorrhage (pulmonary contusion if trauma)
**I**nfarct (pulmonary embolism - very rare in children)
**L**ymphoma (mediastinal > lung)
**D**iagnosis: Antibiotic trial (resolves if pneumonia)

**Key Point:** **In children, round mass = round pneumonia** (until proven otherwise) - antibiotic trial diagnostic

---

## CLINICAL PRESENTATION

**Typical Pediatric CAP:**
- **Acute fever** (38-40°C)
- **Cough** (productive or nonproductive)
- **Dyspnea, tachypnea**
- **Pleuritic chest pain** (if peripheral)
- **Decreased breath sounds** or **crackles** on exam

**Usually NO symptoms suggesting malignancy:**
- No weight loss (unless prolonged)
- No night sweats
- No lymphadenopathy
- No chronic cough (acute onset)

**Key Point:** **Acute febrile illness + round opacity = round pneumonia** (not tumor)

---

## DIAGNOSIS

**Antibiotic Trial = Diagnostic:**

**Approach:**
1. **Start empiric antibiotics** (amoxicillin or ceftriaxone)
2. **Clinical response:** Fever resolves in 24-72 hours
3. **Repeat imaging:** CXR in 7-10 days (opacity shrinking)
4. **Complete resolution:** 2-4 weeks

**If NO Response to Antibiotics:**
- **Consider alternative diagnoses** (tumor, TB, fungal)
- **CT chest with contrast** (further characterization)
- **Biopsy** (if no improvement and concern for malignancy)

**Key Point:** **Rapid response to antibiotics confirms diagnosis** (no biopsy needed)

## DISTINGUISHING FROM MALIGNANCY

| **Feature** | **Round Pneumonia** | **Lung Tumor** |
|-------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Age** | **Children <8 years** | **Extremely rare <18 years** |
| **Onset** | **Acute (days)** | **Chronic (weeks to months)** |
| **Fever** | **Present** | **Absent** (unless obstructive pneumonia) |
| **Margins** | **Hazy, ill-defined** | **Sharp, spiculated** |
| **Air bronchograms** | **Present** | **Absent** (or obstructed) |
| **Enhancement** | **None or minimal** | **Enhances** (vascular tumor) |
| **Response to antibiotics** | **Rapid (days)** | **No response** |
| **Follow-up imaging** | **Resolves (2-4 weeks)** | **Stable or grows** |

**Key Point:** **Antibiotic response + resolution on f/u imaging = round pneumonia**

---

## TREATMENT

**Same as Pediatric CAP:**

**Outpatient (Mild):**
- **Amoxicillin** 90 mg/kg/day PO divided TID (max 4g/day) x 5-7 days
- **Alternative:** Amoxicillin-clavulanate 90 mg/kg/day PO divided BID

**Inpatient (Moderate-Severe):**
- **Ceftriaxone** 50-100 mg/kg IV daily (max 4g/day) OR
- **Ampicillin** 150-200 mg/kg/day IV divided q6h

**Duration:** 5-7 days (if uncomplicated)

**Key Point:** **High-dose amoxicillin = first-line for CAP in children** (covers S. pneumoniae)

---

## IMAGING FOLLOW-UP

**Timeline:**

**Week 1:**
- **Clinical improvement** (fever resolves in 2-3 days)
- **Repeat CXR** (7-10 days) - opacity should be shrinking

**Week 2-4:**
- **Continued resolution**
- **CXR at 4-6 weeks** (complete resolution expected)

**If No Resolution:**
- **Consider alternative diagnosis** (tumor, TB, fungal, sequestration)
- **CT chest with contrast**
- **Pulmonology consult**
- **Possible biopsy**

**Key Point:** **Follow-up CXR mandatory** (ensure resolution, exclude underlying lesion)

---

## COMPLICATIONS

**Rare (Same as CAP):**
- **Parapneumonic effusion** (10-20%)
- **Empyema** (if effusion infected)
- **Lung abscess** (if necrotizing organism - S. aureus, Klebsiella)
- **Bacteremia** (10-15% with S. pneumoniae)

**Key Point:** **Most cases uncomplicated** (resolve with antibiotics)

---

**Clinical Pearls:**
- **Round pneumonia = pediatric phenomenon** (80-90% children <8 years)
- **Immature collateral ventilation** = infection confined → round appearance
- **Round mass in child = round pneumonia until proven otherwise**
- ***S. pneumoniae* = most common organism** (60-70%)
- **Hazy margins + air bronchograms = pneumonia** (vs sharp tumor margins)
- **Posterior segments most common** (RLL, RUL)
- **Antibiotic trial = diagnostic** (rapid fever resolution, opacity shrinks)
- **Follow-up CXR mandatory** (4-6 weeks, ensure complete resolution)
- **Primary lung cancer extremely rare in children** (<18 years)
- **Treatment: High-dose amoxicillin** 90 mg/kg/day x 5-7 days
- **No biopsy needed** if responds to antibiotics and resolves on imaging

**Media:**

*Chest X-ray of a 5-year-old child showing a round, well-defined opacity in the right lower lobe mimicking a lung mass. Patient presented with 3-day history of fever and cough. Started on amoxicillin with fever resolution in 48 hours. Follow-up CXR at 10 days showed significant reduction in size.*

**Image 2 - Round Pneumonia (CT):**

*CT chest of the same patient showing round consolidation in the posterior segment of the right lower lobe. Note the hazy margins and presence of air bronchograms (arrow), confirming airspace disease rather than solid tumor. No enhancement on contrast images. Resolved completely with antibiotics.*

**Image 3 - Resolution of Round Pneumonia:**

*Serial chest X-rays: (A) Presentation - round opacity RLL. (B) Day 10 - opacity shrinking. (C) Week 4 - complete resolution. Confirms diagnosis of round pneumonia. No biopsy was performed.*
