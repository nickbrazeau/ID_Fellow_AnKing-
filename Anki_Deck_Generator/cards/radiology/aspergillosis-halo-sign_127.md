## Aspergillosis - Halo Sign (Chest Radiology)

**Q:** What is the halo sign in invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, what does it represent pathophysiologically, when does it appear, and what is the differential diagnosis?

**A:**

## DEFINITION

**Halo Sign:**

**"Ground-glass opacity (halo) surrounding a pulmonary nodule or mass"**

**CT Appearance:**
- **Central nodule/mass** (soft tissue density)
- **Surrounding ground-glass opacity** (halo - less dense than nodule)
- **Circular or oval shape**
- **Best seen on lung windows**

**Key Point:** **Halo sign = ground-glass halo around nodule** (looks like "halo" around moon)

---

## PATHOPHYSIOLOGY IN ASPERGILLOSIS

**Mechanism: Angioinvasion → Hemorrhage**

1. ***Aspergillus* hyphae invade pulmonary arterioles**
2. **Vascular thrombosis** and infarction
3. **Pulmonary hemorrhage** into surrounding lung tissue
4. **Ground-glass opacity** = hemorrhage around infarcted core

**Key Point:** **Halo = hemorrhage from angioinvasion** (bleeding into lung parenchyma)

---

## TIMING IN INVASIVE ASPERGILLOSIS

**Early Finding (Week 0-1):**

- **Appears in first 10 days** of angioinvasive infection
- **Transient finding** (disappears after ~7-10 days)
- **Seen during neutropenic phase** (ANC <500)
- **High specificity** (97%) **if seen in neutropenic patient** with fever

**Temporal Sequence:**
1. **Week 0-1:** **Halo sign** (early, hemorrhage)
2. **Week 1-2:** Halo disappears (hemorrhage resorbs)
3. **Week 2-3:** **Air crescent sign** (late, immune recovery)

**Key Point:** **Halo = EARLY finding** (week 0-1) | **Air crescent = LATE finding** (week 2-3)

---

## CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE

**In Neutropenic/Immunocompromised Patient:**

- **Halo sign + fever + neutropenia = invasive aspergillosis** until proven otherwise
- **Sensitivity:** 61-94% (early in disease)
- **Specificity:** 90-97% (in appropriate clinical context)
- **Requires immediate antifungal therapy** (voriconazole)
- **Don't wait for culture** (blood cultures usually negative)

**Key Point:** **Halo sign in neutropenic patient = start antifungals immediately**

---

## DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF HALO SIGN

**Mnemonic: "HALO FUNGUS"**

**H**emorrhage (any cause - trauma, coagulopathy)
**A**spergillosis (invasive - **MOST COMMON** in neutropenic host)
**L**ymphoma (angiocentric)
**O**rganizing pneumonia (cryptogenic or secondary)

**F**ungal infections (mucormycosis, candida, cryptococcus)
**U**remic hemorrhage (pulmonary hemorrhage in renal failure)
**N**odules (metastases with hemorrhage)
**G**ranulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's - hemorrhage)
**U**sual suspects (viral pneumonia - HSV, CMV)
**S**eptic emboli (with hemorrhage)

---

### **Key Distinguishing Features:**

| **Cause** | **Key Clinical Features** |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Invasive aspergillosis** | **Neutropenia (ANC <500), BMT, leukemia, fever** |
| **Mucormycosis** | Diabetic ketoacidosis, sinusitis, reverse halo sign |
| **Organizing pneumonia** | NOT immunocompromised, subacute symptoms |
| **Granulomatosis with polyangiitis** | Upper respiratory involvement, ANCA+, renal disease |
| **Viral (HSV, CMV)** | BMT patients, diffuse disease, rapid progression |
| **Metastases** | Known primary malignancy, multiple nodules |

**Key Point:** **Neutropenia + fever + halo sign = aspergillosis** (start voriconazole)

---

## REVERSED HALO SIGN (Atoll Sign)

**Definition:** **Ground-glass opacity surrounded by ring of consolidation** (opposite of halo)

**Differential:**
- **Organizing pneumonia** (cryptogenic or post-infectious) - **MOST COMMON**
- **Mucormycosis** (angioinvasive fungal infection)
- **TB** (especially in HIV patients)
- **Sarcoidosis** (nodular sarcoid variant)
- **Pulmonary infarction**

**Key Point:** **Reversed halo = consolidation ring around ground-glass** (different from halo sign)

---

## IMAGING FEATURES

**High-Resolution CT (HRCT):**
- **Nodule size:** 1-5cm (variable)
- **Halo thickness:** 3-10mm
- **Distribution:** Random (hematogenous spread)
- **Number:** Single or multiple nodules
- **Associated findings:**
  - **Centrilobular nodules** (bronchogenic spread)
  - **Consolidation** (surrounding)
  - **Pleural effusion** (uncommon)

**Key Point:** **HRCT is diagnostic modality of choice** for halo sign

---

## CLINICAL MANAGEMENT

**When Halo Sign Seen in Immunocompromised Patient:**

1. **Immediate empiric antifungal therapy:**
   - **Voriconazole** 6 mg/kg IV q12h x2 doses → 4 mg/kg IV q12h (first-line)
   - **Liposomal amphotericin B** (alternative)
2. **Bronchoscopy with BAL** (if safe - platelets >50,000)
   - **Galactomannan** (serum + BAL fluid)
   - **Fungal culture**
   - **PCR for *Aspergillus***
3. **Serial CT scans** (every 1-2 weeks)
4. **Monitor for progression** (air crescent sign at week 2-3)
5. **Continue therapy 6-12 weeks** minimum

**Key Point:** **Don't wait for mycology results** (blood cultures negative in 95%)

**Clinical Pearls:**
- **Halo sign = ground-glass opacity surrounding nodule**
- **Represents hemorrhage** from angioinvasion (aspergillosis, mucormycosis)
- **EARLY finding (week 0-1)** in invasive aspergillosis
- **Transient** (disappears after 7-10 days as hemorrhage resorbs)
- **Specificity 90-97%** in neutropenic patient with fever
- **Neutropenia + fever + halo = aspergillosis** (start voriconazole immediately)
- **Halo sign (early) → Air crescent sign (late, weeks 2-3)**
- **Differential:** aspergillosis, mucormycosis, organizing pneumonia, GPA, metastases
- **Reversed halo = consolidation ring around ground-glass** (different finding)
- **Best imaging: HRCT chest**
- **Don't wait for culture** (empiric antifungals based on imaging)
