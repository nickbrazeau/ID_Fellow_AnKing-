## Tuberculosis - Primary TB Complex (Ghon, Ranke Complex)

**Q:** What are the Ghon focus, Ghon complex, and Ranke complex in primary tuberculosis, and what are their radiographic features on chest X-ray and CT?

**A:**

## DEFINITIONS

### **Ghon Focus (Ghon Lesion):**

**"Tuberculous caseating granuloma (tuberculoma) at the site of initial primary TB infection"**

- **Pathology:** Small (0.5-2cm) subpleural granuloma
- **Location:** Usually **lower or middle lobes** (where inhaled bacteria initially lodge)
- **Calcification:** **15% calcify** (becomes radiologically detectable)

**Key Point:** **Ghon focus = initial tuberculous granuloma** (rarely visible unless calcified)

---

### **Ghon Complex:**

**"Ghon focus + ipsilateral hilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy"**

**Components:**
1. **Ghon focus** (peripheral lung parenchymal granuloma)
2. **Ipsilateral hilar/mediastinal lymph nodes** (enlarged, caseating)

**Hallmark of Primary TB**

**Key Point:** **Ghon complex = Ghon focus + lymphadenopathy** (classic primary TB)

---

### **Ranke Complex:**

**"Calcified Ghon complex" (healed primary TB)**

**Components:**
1. **Calcified Ghon focus** (parenchymal calcification)
2. **Calcified ipsilateral lymph nodes** (hilar/mediastinal)

**Radiologically Detectable**
- **Represents healed primary TB**
- **No active infection** (latent TB)

**Key Point:** **Ranke complex = calcified Ghon complex = healed primary TB**

---

## RADIOGRAPHIC FEATURES OF PRIMARY TB

### **Mnemonic: "PRIMARY"**

**P**arenchymal focus (Ghon focus - often lower/middle lobe)
**R**ight hilar lymphadenopathy (most common side)
**I**psilateral mediastinal nodes (paratracheal)
**M**ay have pleural effusion (30-40%)
**A**denopathy DOMINANT feature (>90% children, 10-30% adults)
**R**arely cavitates (10-30%, requires immunocompromise)
**Y**oung children most affected (<5 years)

---

## CHEST X-RAY FINDINGS

### **Primary TB (Ghon Complex):**

**Parenchymal Findings:**
- **Focal consolidation** (0.5-2cm)
- **Lower or middle lobe** location (unlike post-primary TB)
- **Subpleural location** (peripheral)
- **Rarely cavitates** (10-30%, only if immunocompromised)

**Lymphadenopathy (DOMINANT FEATURE):**
- **Right hilar nodes** (most common)
- **Right paratracheal nodes** (contiguous mediastinal spread)
- **>90% of children** have lymphadenopathy
- **10-30% of adults** have lymphadenopathy
- **Unilateral** (ipsilateral to Ghon focus)

**Pleural Effusion:**
- **30-40% of cases**
- **Type IV hypersensitivity reaction** (not direct infection)
- **Exudative, lymphocyte-predominant**

**Key Point:** **Primary TB = lymphadenopathy > parenchymal involvement** (opposite of post-primary)

---

### **Ranke Complex (Healed Primary TB):**

**Chest X-ray:**
- **Calcified parenchymal nodule** (Ghon focus - 0.5-2cm)
- **Calcified ipsilateral hilar/mediastinal lymph nodes**
- **No active infection** (represents healed/latent TB)
- **Incidental finding** in asymptomatic patients

**Key Point:** **Calcified Ghon complex on CXR = old healed TB** (no treatment needed if asymptomatic)

---

## CT FINDINGS

### **Primary TB (Active):**

**Parenchymal Changes:**
- **Focal consolidation** (subpleural, lower/middle lobe)
- **Ground-glass opacities** (surrounding inflammation)
- **Rarely cavitates** (unlike post-primary TB)

**Lymphadenopathy (HALLMARK):**
- **Enlarged hilar/mediastinal nodes** (>1cm short axis)
- **Low-density centers** (caseating necrosis)
- **Rim enhancement** (peripheral enhancement on contrast CT)
- **Right-sided predominance** (right hilar + paratracheal)
- **Ipsilateral to parenchymal focus**

**Pleural Effusion:**
- **Unilateral** (30-40% of cases)
- **Exudative** (lymphocyte-predominant)

**Key Point:** **Primary TB lymph nodes = low-density centers + rim enhancement** (caseating necrosis)

---

### **Ranke Complex (Healed):**

**CT Appearance:**
- **Calcified parenchymal nodule** (dense, homogeneous)
- **Calcified hilar/mediastinal lymph nodes**
- **No enhancement** (inactive)
- **No surrounding inflammation**

**Key Point:** **Ranke complex on CT = punctate calcifications** (lung + lymph nodes)

---

## LOCATION: PRIMARY vs POST-PRIMARY TB

| **Feature** | **Primary TB** | **Post-Primary (Reactivation) TB** |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Parenchymal location** | **Lower/middle lobes** (any lobe) | **Upper lobes (85% posterior segments)** |
| **Lymphadenopathy** | **DOMINANT** (>90% children, 10-30% adults) | Less prominent (~33%) |
| **Cavitation** | **RARE (10-30%)** | **COMMON (20-45%)** |
| **Pleural effusion** | **COMMON (30-40%)** | Less common |
| **Endobronchial spread** | Rare | **COMMON (tree-in-bud)** |
| **Age** | **Children <5 years** | Adults, immunocompromised |

**Key Point:** **Primary TB = lymphadenopathy + lower lobe** | **Post-primary TB = cavitation + upper lobe**

---

## AGE-RELATED DIFFERENCES

### **Children (<5 years):**

- **>90% have lymphadenopathy** (hallmark)
- **Parenchymal focus often small/subtle**
- **Pleural effusion common** (30-40%)
- **Rarely cavitates** (unless immunocompromised)
- **Risk of dissemination** (miliary TB, meningitis)

**Key Point:** **Children with primary TB = huge lymph nodes + small parenchymal focus**

---

### **Adults:**

- **Only 10-30% have lymphadenopathy** (less prominent)
- **Parenchymal involvement more obvious**
- **May mimic post-primary TB** (upper lobe involvement possible)
- **Lower risk of dissemination** (if immunocompetent)

**Key Point:** **Adults with primary TB may have subtle/atypical findings** (lower suspicion)

---

## DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

### **Ghon Complex (Active Primary TB):**

**Mnemonic: "LYMPH NODES"**
- **L**ymphoma (Hodgkin's, NHL)
- **Y**oung patients (primary TB, viral infections)
- **M**alignancy (lung cancer with nodal metastases)
- **P**rimary TB (most common in children)
- **H**istoplasma (endemic fungi - also has necrotic nodes)

**N**on-tuberculous mycobacteria (MAC)
**O**ther fungi (blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis)
**D**rug reaction (rare - lymphadenopathy)
**E**BV (infectious mononucleosis - systemic nodes)
**S**arcoidosis (bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy - non-caseating)

**Key Distinguishing Features for TB:**
- **Rim-enhancing nodes** with low-density centers (caseating necrosis)
- **Unilateral hilar/paratracheal** (right-sided)
- **Parenchymal focus** (Ghon focus)
- **Risk factors:** Recent TB exposure, endemic area, immunocompromised

**Key Point:** **Rim-enhancing necrotic nodes + parenchymal focus = TB or fungal** (vs sarcoid = non-caseating)

---

### **Ranke Complex (Calcified):**

**Differential of Calcified Pulmonary Nodules:**
- **Healed granuloma** (TB, histoplasmosis)
- **Healed pneumonia**
- **Hamartoma** (popcorn calcification)
- **Carcinoid tumor** (rare)

**Key Point:** **Calcified nodule + calcified nodes = healed granulomatous infection** (TB or fungal)

---

## COMPLICATIONS OF PRIMARY TB

**Lymph Node Complications:**

1. **Airway compression** (endobronchial TB)
   - **Right middle lobe syndrome** (RML collapse from node compression)
   - **Lobar atelectasis**
   - **Wheezing, stridor**

2. **Lymph node erosion into airway**
   - **Endobronchial TB** (caseating material in airway)
   - **Tree-in-bud pattern** (endobronchial spread)

3. **Lymph node erosion into vessel**
   - **Hematogenous dissemination** → **miliary TB**

**Pleural Effusion:**
- **Type IV hypersensitivity** (exudative, lymphocytic)
- **Requires thoracentesis** (rule out empyema)

**Dissemination:**
- **Miliary TB** (hematogenous spread)
- **TB meningitis** (especially in children <5 years)

**Key Point:** **Primary TB in children carries risk of dissemination** (miliary TB, meningitis)

---

## CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE

**Ghon Complex (Active Primary TB):**
- **Active TB** (requires treatment)
- **TST/IGRA positive**
- **Infectious** (especially if endobronchial spread)
- **Standard 4-drug RIPE therapy** (2 months RIPE + 4 months RI)

**Ranke Complex (Healed):**
- **Healed/latent TB** (no active infection)
- **TST/IGRA positive** (latent TB)
- **NOT infectious**
- **Consider LTBI treatment** if high-risk (recent infection, immunocompromised)

**Key Point:** **Ghon complex = active TB (treat)** | **Ranke complex = healed TB (consider LTBI treatment)**

---

- **Right hilar + paratracheal nodes** most commonly involved
- **Pleural effusion common** (30-40%, type IV hypersensitivity)
- **Cavitation RARE in primary TB** (10-30%, requires immunocompromise)
- **Primary TB = lymphadenopathy > parenchymal** (opposite of post-primary)
- **Complications:** airway compression (RML syndrome), endobronchial TB, miliary dissemination, meningitis
- **Children <5 years at highest risk** for dissemination (miliary TB, meningitis)
