## Aspergilloma (Fungal Ball) - Chest Radiology

**Q:** What is an aspergilloma (fungal ball), what are its characteristic radiographic features, which patients develop aspergillomas, and how is it managed?

**A:**

## DEFINITION

**Aspergilloma (Mycetoma, "Fungal Ball"):**

**"Mass of *Aspergillus* hyphae colonizing a pre-existing lung cavity"**

**Pathophysiology:**
- ***Aspergillus* colonizes pre-existing cavity** (NOT invasive infection)
- **Fungal ball = tangled mass of hyphae + mucus + cellular debris**
- **Grows within cavity** without invading lung tissue (saprophytic)

**Key Point:** **Aspergilloma = colonization of existing cavity** (non-invasive)

---

## CLASSIC RADIOGRAPHIC FEATURES

### **"Monod's Sign" (Air Crescent Sign around Fungal Ball):**

**Chest X-ray:**
- **Solid round/oval mass** within a **pulmonary cavity**
- **Air crescent** (lucency) surrounds **upper portion** of fungal ball
- **Mobile mass** (changes position with patient positioning)
- **Cavity wall thickening** (variable)

**CT Findings:**
- **Intracavitary mass** (soft tissue density)
- **Air surrounding mass** (crescent-shaped)
- **Gravity-dependent** (ball moves to dependent portion when prone)
- **Thickened cavity wall** (>3mm)
- **Pleural thickening** adjacent to cavity

**Key Point:** **Fungal ball + air crescent + mobility = aspergilloma**

---

## MOBILITY OF FUNGAL BALL

**Diagnostic Test: Prone vs Supine Imaging**

- **Supine:** Fungal ball **falls to posterior** (gravity-dependent)
- **Prone:** Fungal ball **shifts to anterior**
- **Lateral decubitus:** Ball rolls to dependent side

**Key Point:** **Mobile intracavitary mass confirms aspergilloma** (vs fixed mass in invasive disease)

---

## PRE-EXISTING CAVITIES (Underlying Conditions)

**Mnemonic: "CAVITY"**

**C**hronic pulmonary TB (healed cavitary TB) - **MOST COMMON**
**A**BPA (allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis - bronchiectasis)
**V**asculitis (granulomatosis with polyangiitis)
**I**nfarction (old pulmonary infarct)
**T**umor cavity (necrotic cancer, sequestered lobe)
**Y**ou name it (sarcoidosis, bullae, cystic fibrosis, ankylosing spondylitis)

**Key Point:** **Healed TB cavities = #1 site for aspergilloma formation**

---

## PATIENT POPULATION

**Typical Patient:**
- **Chronic lung disease** (TB, sarcoidosis, bronchiectasis)
- **NOT immunocompromised** (unlike invasive aspergillosis)
- **Cough, hemoptysis** (intermittent)
- ***Aspergillus* precipitins positive** (serology - 95% sensitive)

**Key Point:** **Aspergilloma occurs in immunocompetent patients** with chronic cavities

---

## ASPERGILLOMA vs INVASIVE ASPERGILLOSIS

| **Feature** | **Aspergilloma (Fungal Ball)** | **Invasive Aspergillosis** |
|-------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Immune status** | **Immunocompetent** (chronic lung disease) | **Immunocompromised** (neutropenia, BMT) |
| **Pathophysiology** | **Colonization** (saprophytic, non-invasive) | **Invasion** (angioinvasive, tissue destruction) |
| **Cavity** | **Pre-existing cavity** (TB, sarcoid) | **Newly formed** (from infarction) |
| **Mass mobility** | **Mobile** (moves with gravity) | **Fixed** (necrotic tissue attached) |
| **Air crescent** | **Yes** (around fungal ball) | **Yes** (late finding, immune recovery) |
| **Timing** | **Chronic** (months-years) | **Acute/subacute** (weeks) |
| **Treatment** | **Observation OR surgery** (if hemoptysis) | **Antifungal therapy** (voriconazole) |
| **Antifungals** | **Ineffective** (no tissue penetration) | **Essential** |

**Key Point:** **Aspergilloma = colonization in immunocompetent** | **Invasive = infection in neutropenic**

---

## CLINICAL PRESENTATION

**Symptoms:**
- **Asymptomatic** (50% - incidental finding)
- **Chronic cough** (productive, blood-tinged)
- **Hemoptysis** (intermittent, mild)
- **Massive hemoptysis** (5-10% - life-threatening)
- **Weight loss, fever** (if superinfection)

**Laboratory:**
- ***Aspergillus* precipitins** (IgG antibodies - 95% positive)
- **Sputum culture** (may grow *Aspergillus* - not diagnostic)
- **Galactomannan** (usually negative - colonization, not invasion)
- **Eosinophilia** (if ABPA component)

**Key Point:** **Most common presentation = chronic cough + hemoptysis + CXR mass**

---

## COMPLICATIONS

**Major Complication: MASSIVE HEMOPTYSIS**

**Mechanism:**
- **Erosion of fungal ball into pulmonary artery/bronchial artery**
- **Friable vessels in cavity wall**
- **Rasmussen aneurysm** (pulmonary artery aneurysm in TB cavity)

**Risk Factors for Hemoptysis:**
- **Large aspergilloma** (>3cm)
- **Thin cavity wall** (<3mm)
- **Adjacent to major vessels**
- **Active cough** (mechanical trauma)

**Management of Massive Hemoptysis:**
- **Bronchial artery embolization** (BAE - temporizing)
- **Surgical resection** (definitive treatment if candidate)

**Key Point:** **Massive hemoptysis = life-threatening complication** (5-10% of cases)

---

## TREATMENT

### **Asymptomatic Aspergilloma:**

**Observation:**
- **Serial CXR/CT** (every 6-12 months)
- **Monitor for hemoptysis**
- **Antifungals NOT indicated** (poor penetration into cavity)

**Key Point:** **Asymptomatic aspergilloma = watch and wait** (antifungals don't work)

---

### **Symptomatic (Hemoptysis):**

**Options:**

1. **Bronchial Artery Embolization (BAE):**
   - **First-line for massive hemoptysis** (temporizing)
   - **Success rate:** 70-90% (short-term)
   - **Recurrence common** (50% at 1 year)

2. **Surgical Resection:**
   - **Definitive treatment** (curative)
   - **Indications:** Recurrent/massive hemoptysis, adequate lung function
   - **Mortality:** 5-10% (high-risk surgery in chronic lung disease patients)

3. **Intracavitary Antifungals:**
   - **Percutaneous instillation** of amphotericin B (rare)
   - **Limited evidence**

4. **Oral Antifungals (Controversial):**
   - **Itraconazole or voriconazole** (months)
   - **May reduce fungal ball size** in some cases (limited data)
   - **Not first-line**

**Key Point:** **Massive hemoptysis = BAE (temporizing) → surgery (definitive)**

## RADIOGRAPHIC DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

**Intracavitary Mass:**

**Mnemonic: "FUNGAL BALL"**
- **F**ungal ball (aspergilloma) - **MOST COMMON**
- **U**sual suspects (blood clot, mucus plug)
- **N**eoplasm (intracavitary tumor, carcinoma)
- **G**ranuloma (necrotic lymph node)
- **A**bscess debris (necrotizing pneumonia)
- **L**ung gangrene (necrotic lung tissue)

**B**acterial colonization (chronic abscess)
**A**spiration (foreign body)
**L**ung cyst (hydatid cyst with collapsed membranes)
**L**ung sequestration (congenital)

**Key Point:** **Mobile intracavitary mass in TB cavity = aspergilloma** (until proven otherwise)

---

## PROGNOSIS

**Natural History:**
- **Stable** (50% - no growth over years)
- **Spontaneous lysis** (10% - fungal ball disappears)
- **Growth** (30% - enlarging over time)
- **Hemoptysis** (50% - mild to massive)
- **Mortality from hemoptysis** (5-10% - if massive)

**Key Point:** **Most aspergillomas remain stable** (but hemoptysis risk persists)

---

**Clinical Pearls:**
- **Aspergilloma = *Aspergillus* colonizing pre-existing cavity** (non-invasive)
- **Classic finding: Mobile intracavitary mass with air crescent** (Monod's sign)
- **Mobility = diagnostic** (ball moves with patient positioning)
- **Occurs in immunocompetent patients** with chronic lung disease (TB, sarcoid)
- **Most common pre-existing cavity: Healed TB cavitation**
- ***Aspergillus* precipitins positive** (IgG antibodies - 95% sensitive)
- **Presentation:** asymptomatic (50%) OR hemoptysis (mild-massive)
- **Major complication: Massive hemoptysis** (5-10% - erosion into vessel)
- **Treatment asymptomatic: Observation** (antifungals don't penetrate cavity)
- **Treatment hemoptysis: BAE (temporizing) → Surgery (definitive)**
- **Antifungals NOT effective** (poor penetration into cavity)
- **Differential: Blood clot, tumor, abscess debris, hydatid cyst**
- **Prognosis: 50% stable, 10% spontaneous lysis, 30% growth, 5-10% death from hemoptysis**
