## Tuberculosis - Miliary Pattern (Chest Radiology)

**Q:** What is miliary tuberculosis, what are its characteristic radiographic features on chest X-ray and CT, and what is the differential diagnosis of miliary nodules?

**A:**

## DEFINITION

**Miliary Tuberculosis:**

**"Hematogenous dissemination of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* producing diffuse 1-3mm pulmonary nodules"**

**Etymology:** **"Miliary" = resembles millet seeds** (tiny grain seeds ~2mm diameter)
- Term first used by **John Jacob Manget (1700)**
- Historical name: **"Miliary Koch's infiltration"** (after Robert Koch)

**Key Point:** **Miliary TB = hematogenous spread = disseminated infection**

---

## RADIOGRAPHIC FEATURES

### **Chest X-ray:**

**Classic Appearance:**
- **Diffuse, bilateral micronodules** (1-3mm)
- **"Sandstorm" or "snowstorm" pattern**
- **Uniform size and distribution**
- **May be subtle on initial films** (can take 2-6 weeks to become visible)
- **No lymphadenopathy** (unlike primary TB)

**Key Point:** **Miliary TB may be initially normal on CXR** (CT more sensitive)

---

### **CT Findings:**

**Nodule Characteristics:**
- **Size:** **1-3mm** diameter (uniform)
- **Distribution:** **Random** (affects all lung zones equally)
- **Number:** Innumerable (countless nodules)
- **Density:** Soft tissue attenuation
- **Shape:** Round, well-defined

**Distribution Pattern: "Random"**
- **Random distribution** (affects airways, vessels, pleura, interlobular septa equally)
- **No zonal predominance** (upper = middle = lower lobes)
- **Involves all secondary pulmonary lobules**

**Key Point:** **Miliary TB = 1-3mm random nodules = "millet seed" pattern**

---

## PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

**Mechanism: Hematogenous Dissemination**

**Two Possible Origins:**
1. **Primary TB** (Ghon focus erodes into blood vessel)
2. **Post-primary TB** (cavity erodes into pulmonary vein)

**Sequence:**
1. **MTB enters bloodstream** (from eroded focus or cavity)
2. **Bacteremia** → hematogenous seeding
3. **MTB deposits in lungs** (and other organs)
4. **Granuloma formation** → 1-3mm nodules
5. **Multiorgan involvement** (liver, spleen, bone marrow, meninges)

**Key Point:** **Miliary TB = uncontrolled TB = hematogenous spread = multiorgan involvement**

---

## CLINICAL CONTEXT & RISK FACTORS

**High-Risk Populations:**

**Mnemonic: "MILIARY"**
- **M**alnutrition
- **I**mmunosuppression (HIV, steroids, biologics, transplant)
- **L**ittle kids (<5 years old)
- **I**nadequate TB treatment (non-adherence, resistance)
- **A**IDS (CD4 <200)
- **R**eactivation TB (elderly, immunocompromised)
- **Y**oung children and elderly

**Key Point:** **Miliary TB occurs with severe immunocompromise or primary TB in children**

---

## CLINICAL PRESENTATION

**Symptoms (Often Nonspecific):**
- **Fever, night sweats, weight loss** (weeks-months)
- **Dyspnea, cough** (often dry)
- **Hepatosplenomegaly** (multiorgan involvement)
- **Meningitis symptoms** (if CNS involvement)
- **Choroidal tubercles** (ophthalmoscopy - pathognomonic if present)

**Laboratory:**
- **Pancytopenia** (bone marrow involvement)
- **Elevated alkaline phosphatase** (hepatic involvement)
- **Hyponatremia** (SIADH or adrenal insufficiency)

**Key Point:** **Miliary TB = systemic symptoms + pancytopenia + hepatosplenomegaly**

---

## DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF MILIARY NODULES

### **Mnemonic: "MILIARY SEEDS"**

**M**etastases (thyroid, renal, melanoma)
**I**nfections (fungal - histoplasma, blasto, coccidioides)
**L**angerhans cell histiocytosis
**I**nfluenza (viral pneumonia - tree-in-bud vs true miliary)
**A**lveolar microlithiasis
**R**heumatoid nodules (rare)
**Y**ersinia (plague - pneumonic)

**S**arcoidosis (miliary sarcoidosis)
**E**osinophilic granuloma
**E**mboli (septic emboli)
**D**rugs (amiodarone, methotrexate pneumonitis)
**S**ilicosis (chronic exposure)

---

### **Most Common Differential Diagnoses:**

| **Condition** | **Nodule Size** | **Distribution** | **Key Features** |
|---------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Miliary TB** | 1-3mm | Random | Immunocompromised, systemic symptoms, multiorgan |
| **Metastases** | 1-10mm (variable) | Random | Known primary malignancy (thyroid, renal, melanoma) |
| **Sarcoidosis** | 1-5mm | **Perilymphatic** | Hilar lymphadenopathy, upper/mid lobe predominance |
| **Histoplasmosis** | 1-3mm | Random | Endemic area, calcified nodules (chronic) |
| **Silicosis** | 1-10mm | **Upper lobe** | Occupational exposure, calcified nodules, eggshell LN |
| **Fungal (disseminated)** | 1-5mm | Random | Immunocompromised, endemic exposure |
| **Hypersensitivity pneumonitis** | 1-5mm | Random/centrilobular | Exposure history, ground-glass opacities |

**Key Point:** **Random distribution + immunocompromise = TB or fungal** (vs perilymphatic = sarcoid)

---

## DISTINGUISHING FEATURES: TB vs OTHER CAUSES

**Miliary TB Clues:**
- **Risk factors:** HIV, immunosuppression, endemic exposure
- **Systemic symptoms:** Fever, night sweats, weight loss (weeks-months)
- **Multiorgan involvement:** Hepatosplenomegaly, bone marrow involvement (pancytopenia)
- **CNS involvement:** TB meningitis (high protein, low glucose CSF)
- **Choroidal tubercles** (pathognomonic if present)
- **AFB smear:** Often negative initially (low bacillary burden in lungs)
- **Culture:** May require bone marrow, liver biopsy, or BAL

**Key Point:** **Negative sputum AFB does NOT rule out miliary TB** (consider biopsy/BAL)

---

## NODULE DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS (HELPS NARROW DDx)

| **Distribution** | **Most Likely Causes** |
|------------------|------------------------|
| **Random** | **TB, metastases, fungal (histo, blasto), septic emboli** |
| **Perilymphatic** (bronchovascular, pleural) | **Sarcoidosis, silicosis, lymphangitic carcinomatosis** |
| **Centrilobular** | **Hypersensitivity pneumonitis, respiratory bronchiolitis** |

**Key Point:** **Random distribution = hematogenous** (TB, mets, fungal) | **Perilymphatic = lymphatic** (sarcoid, silicosis)

---

## ASSOCIATED FINDINGS IN MILIARY TB

**Extrapulmonary TB (Multiorgan Involvement):**

| **Organ** | **Findings** |
|-----------|--------------|
| **CNS** | **TB meningitis** (basilar enhancement, hydrocephalus), **tuberculomas** |
| **Liver/Spleen** | Hepatosplenomegaly, microabscesses (hypodense on CT) |
| **Bone marrow** | **Pancytopenia**, granulomas on biopsy |
| **Adrenal** | Adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) |
| **Eyes** | **Choroidal tubercles** (1-3mm yellow retinal lesions - pathognomonic) |
| **GI** | Peritoneal TB, ascites |

**Key Point:** **Miliary TB is a systemic disease** (always evaluate for extrapulmonary involvement)

---

## DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH

**When Miliary Nodules Seen:**

1. **Assess risk factors:** HIV status, immunosuppression, TB exposure
2. **Sputum AFB x3:** (Often negative in miliary TB)
3. **Blood cultures:** (MTB bacteremia possible)
4. **Bone marrow biopsy/culture:** (High yield in miliary TB)
5. **Lumbar puncture:** (if CNS symptoms - rule out TB meningitis)
6. **Ophthalmoscopy:** (look for choroidal tubercles)
7. **Bronchoscopy with BAL/biopsy:** (if sputum negative)
8. **NAAT testing:** (GeneXpert MTB/RIF on sputum, BAL, CSF)

**Key Point:** **Miliary TB often requires invasive testing** (bone marrow, BAL, LP) for diagnosis

---

## PROGNOSIS & TREATMENT RESPONSE

**Prognosis:**
- **Historically fatal** if untreated
- **Good prognosis with treatment** if diagnosed early
- **Mortality ~20-25%** (even with treatment) due to delayed diagnosis

**Radiographic Response:**
- **Nodules resolve completely** with successful treatment (unlike post-primary TB)
- **No residual scarring** (if treatment successful)
- **Resolution takes 6-12 months**

**Key Point:** **Miliary TB completely resolves with treatment** (no residual abnormality)

---

## CLINICAL PEARLS: MILIARY TB

**Remember:**
- **Miliary = hematogenous dissemination = multiorgan TB**
- **CXR may be initially normal** (CT more sensitive)
- **Random distribution** (affects all lung zones equally)
- **Sputum AFB often negative** (requires bone marrow, BAL, or biopsy)
- **Always check for TB meningitis** (lumbar puncture if CNS symptoms)
- **Look for choroidal tubercles** (pathognomonic if present)
- **Pancytopenia suggests bone marrow involvement**
- **Complete resolution expected with successful treatment** (no residual scarring)

---

**Clinical Pearls:**
- **Miliary TB = 1-3mm random nodules ("millet seeds") from hematogenous spread**
- **CXR may be normal initially** (takes 2-6 weeks to become visible)

- **Random distribution** (no upper/lower lobe predominance)
- **Multiorgan involvement common:** meningitis, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia
- **Sputum AFB often negative** (low bacillary burden in lungs)
- **Bone marrow biopsy/culture has high yield** for diagnosis
- **Check for choroidal tubercles** (pathognomonic yellow retinal lesions)
- **Always perform LP if CNS symptoms** (rule out TB meningitis)
- **Differential:** metastases, sarcoid (perilymphatic), fungal (histo, blasto), silicosis
- **Prognosis good with treatment** (complete resolution, no residual scarring)
- **Mortality 20-25% even with treatment** (due to delayed diagnosis)
