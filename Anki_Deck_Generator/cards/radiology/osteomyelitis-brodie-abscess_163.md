## Osteomyelitis - Brodie Abscess

**Q:** What is a Brodie abscess, what are its characteristic imaging features, and how does it differ from acute osteomyelitis?

**A:**

## DEFINITION

**Brodie Abscess:** **"Localized subacute/chronic intraosseous abscess, typically metaphyseal in children/young adults"**

**Imaging Hallmark:** **Well-circumscribed lytic lesion with sclerotic rim in metaphysis**

**Key Point:** **Brodie abscess = indolent infection** (weeks to months of symptoms)

---

## PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

**Formation:**

**Mnemonic: "INDOLENT-STAPH-METAPHYSIS"**

**I**ndolent course (slow-growing, subacute/chronic)
**N**ot acute (unlike typical osteomyelitis)
**D**ays to weeks (or months) of symptoms
**O**rganisms low virulence (or partially treated)
**L**ocalized (well-contained abscess)
**E**ncapsulated (body walls off infection)
**N**o systemic symptoms (usually afebrile)
**T**rap for bacteria (loculated abscess cavity)

**S**taphylococcus aureus (90% - most common organism)
**T**ypically low-virulence strain (or partially treated)
**A**bscess formation (intraosseous cavity)
**P**artially treated (antibiotics given before definitive diagnosis)
**H**ematogenous spread (initial seeding, but contained)

**M**etaphysis (most common location - 75-90%)
**E**nd of long bone (distal tibia, proximal/distal femur)
**T**ibia distal (most common site - 50%)
**A**cute phase contained (body walls off infection)
**P**roximal tibia (second most common)
**H**ost immune response (forms sclerotic rim)
**Y**oung patients (children, adolescents, young adults <25 years)
**S**clerotic rim (hallmark - body's containment)
**I**ndolent infection (slow, smoldering)
**S**ubacute presentation

**Key Point:** **Brodie abscess = subacute osteomyelitis** (weeks to months, localized, indolent)

---

## EPIDEMIOLOGY

**Age:**
- **Children and young adults** (50-80% occur <25 years)
- **Peak age:** 10-20 years
- **Can occur at any age** (including adults)

**Location:**
- **Metaphysis of long bones** (75-90%)
- **Lower extremity >> upper** (90% lower)
- **Most common sites:**
  1. **Distal tibia** (50%)
  2. **Proximal tibia** (20%)
  3. **Distal femur** (10%)
  4. **Proximal femur** (5%)

**Key Point:** **Distal tibia = most common site** (50% of Brodie abscesses)

---

## IMAGING CHARACTERISTICS

**Hallmark: Well-Circumscribed Lytic Lesion with Sclerotic Rim**

### **X-RAY FINDINGS:**

**Mnemonic: "LYTIC-RIM-GEOGRAPHIC"**

**L**ytic lesion (lucent, radiolucent defect)
**Y**outh (children, young adults)
**T**ibia distal (most common site)
**I**ntramedullary (within bone)
**C**ircumscribed (well-defined borders)

**R**im sclerosis (hallmark - white border)
**I**ntraosseous (within bone cavity)
**M**etaphyseal (classic location)

**G**eographic pattern (Type IA lesion - slow-growing)
**E**ncapsulated (sclerotic margin)
**O**val or round shape
**G**rowing slowly (indolent)
**R**adiolucent center (pus, granulation tissue)
**A**bscess cavity (lucent)
**P**roximal or distal metaphysis
**H**allmark sclerotic rim
**I**solated (solitary lesion)
**C**ortex may be thinned (endosteal scalloping)

**Additional Features:**
- **Size:** 1-4 cm (usually)
- **Periosteal reaction:** Absent or minimal (key differentiator from acute osteomyelitis)
- **Soft tissue swelling:** Minimal or absent
- **Cortical involvement:** May thin cortex (endosteal scalloping)
- **Serpentine tract:** Occasionally extends to physis or joint (10-15%)

**Key Point:** **Well-defined lytic lesion + sclerotic rim + metaphysis = Brodie abscess**

---

## CT FINDINGS

**CT Characteristics:**
- **Well-circumscribed lytic lesion** (low attenuation center)
- **Sclerotic rim** (high attenuation border)
- **Central fluid density** (pus, granulation tissue)
- **Endosteal scalloping** (cortical thinning from inside)
- **Penumbra sign:** Intermediate zone between abscess and sclerotic rim (granulation tissue)
- **Minimal periosteal reaction** (unlike acute osteomyelitis)

**Key Point:** **Penumbra sign = granulation tissue** zone (intermediate attenuation between abscess and sclerotic rim)

---

## MRI FINDINGS (Most Sensitive)

**MRI = Gold Standard for Diagnosis**

**T1 Weighted:**
- **Hypointense cavity** (abscess center - pus)
- **Hypointense rim** (sclerotic bone)
- **Penumbra zone:** Slightly hyperintense (granulation tissue between abscess and sclerotic rim)

**T2/STIR:**
- **Hyperintense cavity** (fluid, pus)
- **Hypointense rim** (sclerotic bone - low signal)
- **Hyperintense penumbra** (granulation tissue)
- **Mild surrounding marrow edema** (T2 hyperintense)

**Post-Contrast T1 Fat-Saturated:**
- **Rim enhancement** (abscess wall - granulation tissue enhances)
- **Penumbra enhancement** (granulation tissue enhances)
- **Central abscess does NOT enhance** (purulent fluid)
- **Surrounding marrow enhancement** (mild inflammatory edema)

**DWI/ADC:**
- **DWI hyperintense** (restricted diffusion - purulent abscess)
- **ADC hypointense** (low ADC values)
- **Confirms purulent nature**

**Key Point:** **Rim enhancement + central non-enhancing cavity + restricted diffusion = Brodie abscess**

---

## PENUMBRA SIGN

**Penumbra Sign:** **"Intermediate signal zone between abscess and sclerotic rim"**

**Composition:** Granulation tissue (inflamed vascularized tissue)

**MRI Appearance:**
- **T1:** Slightly hyperintense (relative to central abscess)
- **T2:** Hyperintense (edema in granulation tissue)
- **Post-contrast:** Enhances (vascularized)

**Key Point:** **Penumbra = granulation tissue** (vascularized inflammatory rim)

---

## CLINICAL PRESENTATION

**Symptoms:**
- **Localized bone pain** (weeks to months, insidious onset)
- **Minimal or no fever** (afebrile or low-grade)
- **Local tenderness** (over affected bone)
- **Limp** (if lower extremity)
- **No systemic symptoms** (patient looks well)

**Duration:**
- **Weeks to months** (average 3-6 months before diagnosis)
- **Indolent course** (slowly progressive)

**Key Point:** **Brodie abscess = afebrile, indolent bone pain** (weeks to months)

---

## LABS

**Inflammatory Markers:**
- **WBC:** Usually normal (50-70%)
- **ESR/CRP:** May be mildly elevated or normal (50% normal)
- **Blood cultures:** Usually negative (>90%)

**Key Point:** **Normal labs common** (unlike acute osteomyelitis with elevated WBC/CRP)

---

## ORGANISMS

**Staphylococcus aureus:** 90% (most common)
- **MSSA** (more common than MRSA in subacute)
- **Low-virulence strains** (or partially treated)

**Other Organisms (Rare):**
- **Coagulase-negative Staph** (S. epidermidis)
- **Streptococcus** species
- **Pseudomonas aeruginosa** (IVDU, puncture wound)
- **Kingella kingae** (young children <4 years)

**Sterile Cultures:** 20-30% (partially treated or culture-negative)

**Key Point:** **S. aureus = 90%** (MSSA > MRSA in subacute infections)

---

## DIAGNOSIS

**Imaging:**
- **X-ray:** Initial screening (shows lytic lesion + sclerotic rim)
- **MRI with contrast:** Gold standard (90-95% sensitive)
- **CT:** If MRI contraindicated (shows penumbra sign)

**Tissue Diagnosis:**
- **CT-guided aspiration or biopsy** (for culture + histology)
- **Surgical curettage** with culture (definitive)

**Culture:**
- **S. aureus** in 70-80%
- **Sterile** in 20-30% (partially treated or fastidious organisms)

**Key Point:** **MRI + CT-guided biopsy** for diagnosis and organism identification

---

## DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

**Mnemonic: "BRODIE-TUMOR-EOSINOPHILIC"**

**Brodie Abscess:**
- **Well-defined lytic + sclerotic rim + metaphysis**
- **History of indolent pain**
- **Minimal periosteal reaction**

**Osteoid Osteoma:**
- **Small nidus (<2 cm)** with intense sclerosis
- **Severe night pain** (relieved by NSAIDs)
- **Central nidus enhances avidly** (vs Brodie rim enhances)

**Eosinophilic Granuloma (Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis):**
- **Lytic lesion** (punched-out)
- **Younger children** (peak <5 years)
- **Diaphysis > metaphysis** (Brodie = metaphysis)
- **Soft tissue mass** (Brodie = minimal soft tissue)

**Bone Cyst (Unicameral Bone Cyst):**
- **Lytic lesion**
- **Metaphysis** (similar location)
- **No sclerotic rim** (key differentiator - Brodie has rim)
- **No enhancement** (cyst is fluid-filled, Brodie rim enhances)

**Osteoblastoma:**
- **Expansile lytic lesion** with mineralized matrix
- **Posterior elements** (spine) more common
- **Larger (>2 cm)** than osteoid osteoma

**Chondroblastoma:**
- **Epiphyseal** (crosses physis - Brodie is metaphyseal)
- **Adolescents** (peak 10-20 years, similar age)
- **Calcifications** within lesion (Brodie has none)

**Giant Cell Tumor:**
- **Epiphyseal/metaphyseal** (extends to subchondral bone)
- **After physeal closure** (>20 years)
- **No sclerotic rim** (lytic, expansile)

**Key Point:** **Sclerotic rim + metaphysis + minimal periosteal reaction = Brodie abscess** (vs tumor)

## TREATMENT

**Medical Management (If Small, Non-Weight-Bearing):**

**Criteria for Medical Therapy Alone:**
- **Small abscess** (<1-2 cm)
- **Non-weight-bearing bone** (e.g., fibula)
- **Minimal symptoms**
- **Culture-proven** organism (CT-guided aspiration)

**Antibiotics:**
- **Empiric (until cultures):** Vancomycin + ceftriaxone
- **Targeted (S. aureus):**
  - **MSSA:** Cefazolin 2g IV q8h x 4-6 weeks
  - **MRSA:** Vancomycin OR daptomycin x 4-6 weeks
- **Oral step-down:** Consider after clinical improvement (if high bioavailability agents like linezolid, TMP-SMX, or fluoroquinolones)

**Duration:** 4-6 weeks IV (minimum)

**Success Rate (Medical Alone):** 60-70% (if small abscess, appropriate antibiotics)

**Key Point:** **Medical therapy alone = 60-70% success** (if small abscess, appropriate organism coverage)

---

**Surgical Management (Preferred, Definitive):**

**Indications:**
- **Large abscess** (>2 cm)
- **Weight-bearing bone** (tibia, femur)
- **Failed medical therapy** (persistent symptoms after 2-4 weeks)
- **Diagnostic uncertainty** (need tissue for diagnosis)
- **Cortical involvement** (risk of pathologic fracture)

**Procedure:**
- **Curettage** (scrape out abscess cavity)
- **Debridement** of surrounding granulation tissue
- **Bone biopsy** (send for culture + histology)
- **Bone graft** (fill cavity with autograft or allograft)
- **Consider antibiotic beads** (local delivery)

**Post-Operative:**
- **IV antibiotics** 4-6 weeks (based on cultures)
- **Weight-bearing restriction** (6-8 weeks if large defect)

**Success Rate (Surgery + Antibiotics):** 90-95%

**Key Point:** **Curettage + antibiotics = 90-95% cure** (definitive treatment)

---

## PROGNOSIS

**With Appropriate Treatment:**
- **Cure rate:** 90-95% (surgery + antibiotics)
- **Recurrence:** <5%

**Without Treatment:**
- **Chronic infection** (smoldering)
- **Cortical breakthrough** (sinus tract formation)
- **Pathologic fracture** (if cortex weakened)

**Key Point:** **Excellent prognosis with surgery** (90-95% cure)

---

## COMPLICATIONS

**Mnemonic: "FRACTURE-CHRONIC-RECURRENCE"**

**F**racture (pathologic, through weakened cortex)
**R**ecurrence (<5% if adequately treated)
**A**cute exacerbation (transition to acute osteomyelitis)
**C**hronic osteomyelitis (if untreated)
**T**ransition to acute (rare)
**U**nhealed cavity (if not curetted)
**R**efractory pain (chronic)
**E**xtension to joint (rare, 10-15%)

**C**hronic infection (if untreated)
**H**allmark sequelae rare (usually cures with treatment)
**R**are complications (overall good prognosis)
**O**steonecrosis (uncommon)
**N**eighboring joint involvement (rare)
**I**nadequate treatment (leads to recurrence)
**C**ortical breakthrough (sinus tract)

**R**ecurrence (<5%)
**E**xtension to physis (growth disturbance - rare)
**C**omplications uncommon (good prognosis)
**U**sually cures with treatment
**R**arely progresses to acute
**R**esidual defect (if large)
**E**xcellent outcome (90-95%)
**N**eeds surgery for best results
**C**avity refills with bone (after curettage)
**E**nduring cure (rarely relapses)

**Key Point:** **Complications rare** with appropriate treatment (excellent prognosis)
