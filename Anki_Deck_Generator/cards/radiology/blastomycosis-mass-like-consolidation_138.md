## Blastomycosis - Mass-Like Consolidation (Mimics Malignancy)

**Q:** What are the characteristic CT findings of pulmonary blastomycosis including mass-like consolidation, and how does it mimic lung cancer?

**A:**

## DEFINITION

**Blastomycosis:** Endemic fungal infection caused by ***Blastomyces dermatitidis***, dimorphic fungus in soil near waterways.

**Geographic Distribution:** **Great Lakes, Ohio River Valley, Mississippi River Valley, Southeastern US** ("North of the Mason-Dixon line")

**Key Point:** **Blastomycosis = Great Lakes region + mass-like consolidation mimicking cancer**

---

## CT FINDINGS

**Hallmark: Mass-Like Consolidation (Mimics Malignancy)**

### **Mnemonic: "BLASTO-MASS"**

**B**ig consolidation (mass-like, >5cm)
**L**ymph nodes enlarged (hilar/mediastinal)
**A**lveolar consolidation (dense, homogeneous)
**S**piculatedmargins (mimics lung cancer)
**T**hick-walled cavities (20-30% of cases)
**O**ften upper lobes (but variable)

**M**imics malignancy (requires biopsy)
**A**ir bronchograms (within consolidation)
**S**kin involvement (verrucous lesions - clinical clue)
**S**ingle or multiple nodules (1-10cm)

---

## IMAGING PATTERNS

### **1. Mass-Like Consolidation (Most Common - 40-60%):**

**Characteristics:**
- **Large, dense consolidation** (>5cm)
- **Irregular, spiculated margins** (mimics bronchogenic carcinoma)
- **Air bronchograms** (may be present)
- **Homogeneous** or **heterogeneous** density
- **Location:** Variable (upper lobes slightly more common)
- **Mimics lung cancer** (requires biopsy to distinguish)

**Key Point:** **Mass-like consolidation with spiculated margins = biopsy** (exclude malignancy)

---

### **2. Nodules/Masses (30-40%):**

**Characteristics:**
- **Single or multiple nodules** (1-10cm)
- **Well-defined or irregular margins**
- **May be cavitary** (20-30%)
- **Mimics metastatic disease** if multiple

**Key Point:** **Solitary pulmonary nodule in endemic area = blastomycosis vs malignancy**

---

### **3. Cavitation (20-30%):**

**Characteristics:**
- **Thick-walled cavities** (>4mm)
- **Irregular inner lining**
- **May have air-fluid levels**
- **Upper lobe predominance** (when cavitary)

**Key Point:** **Thick-walled cavitary lesion = TB, Nocardia, fungi (Blasto, Histo), lung abscess, cancer**

---

### **4. Alveolar Infiltrates (20-30%):**

**Characteristics:**
- **Patchy or lobar consolidation**
- **Air bronchograms**
- **Mimics bacterial pneumonia**
- **May be bilateral**

**Key Point:** **Pneumonia not responding to antibiotics in endemic area = consider blastomycosis**

---

### **5. Miliary Pattern (Disseminated - Rare):**

**Characteristics:**
- **Small nodules** (1-3mm, random distribution)
- **Bilateral, diffuse**
- **In immunocompromised** (HIV, transplant, steroids)
- **ARDS pattern** (severe, life-threatening)

**Key Point:** **ARDS + miliary pattern + endemic area = disseminated blastomycosis** (high mortality)

---

## CLINICAL PRESENTATION

### **Mnemonic: "SKIN-LUNG-BONE"**

**Three Major Manifestations:**

**1. SKIN (20-80% of cases):**
- **Verrucous (warty) lesions** - MOST CHARACTERISTIC
- **Crusted plaques** (face, extremities)
- **Ulcers** (painless, elevated borders)
- **Subcutaneous nodules**
- **Mimics squamous cell carcinoma**

**Key Point:** **Verrucous skin lesions + pneumonia = blastomycosis**

---

**2. LUNG (60-90% of cases):**
- **Acute pneumonia** (fever, cough, chest pain)
- **Chronic pneumonia** (weeks to months, mimics TB)
- **Hemoptysis** (if cavitation)
- **Dyspnea, weight loss, night sweats**

**Key Point:** **Pneumonia not responding to antibiotics + skin lesions = consider blastomycosis**

---

**3. BONE (10-50% of disseminated cases):**
- **Osteomyelitis** (vertebrae, ribs, skull, long bones)
- **Septic arthritis**
- **Cold abscess** (mimics TB)

**Key Point:** **Vertebral osteomyelitis in endemic area = TB vs Blasto vs Brucella**

---

### **Other Sites (Disseminated Disease):**

**Genitourinary (10-30%):**
- **Prostatitis** (most common GU site)
- **Epididymo-orchitis**
- **Renal involvement**

**CNS (<5%):**
- **Brain abscess** (single or multiple)
- **Meningitis** (rare)

**Key Point:** **Disseminated blastomycosis = skin + lung + bone + prostate**

---

## DIAGNOSIS

**Gold Standard: Culture + Histopathology**

**Microscopy:**
- **KOH preparation** (sputum, skin scraping)
- **Appearance:** **Broad-based budding yeast** (8-15 μm)
- **Thick, refractile cell wall**
- **"Figure-8" appearance** (characteristic)

**Culture:**
- **Sabouraud agar** (25°C - mold form)
- **Blood agar** (37°C - yeast form)
- **Slow-growing** (1-4 weeks)
- **Dimorphic:** Mold at 25°C, yeast at 37°C

**Histopathology:**
- **GMS or PAS stain**
- **Broad-based budding yeast**
- **Granulomatous inflammation** with suppuration
- **Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia** (skin lesions - mimics squamous cell carcinoma)

**Antigen Detection:**
- **Urine/serum *Blastomyces* antigen** (75-90% sensitive in disseminated disease)
- **Cross-reacts with *Histoplasma*** (may be false positive in histoplasmosis)

**Serology:**
- **Antibody testing** (not sensitive, not routinely used)

**Key Point:** **Broad-based budding yeast = Blastomyces** (vs Cryptococcus narrow-based budding)

---

## DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

**Mass-Like Consolidation:**

**Mnemonic: "MASS MIMICS"**

**M**alignancy (bronchogenic carcinoma - **most important to exclude**)
**A**denopathy (lymphoma, sarcoidosis)
**S**piculatedlesion (lung cancer, organizing pneumonia)
**S**kin lesions (blastomycosis clue - verrucous plaques)

**M**ycobacteria (TB - upper lobe cavitation)
**I**nfection (Blastomycosis, Nocardia, Actinomycosis, fungi)
**M**etastatic disease (multiple nodules)
**I**nflammatory (organizing pneumonia, GPA)
**C**ryptococcosis (nodules in immunocompromised)
**S**eptic emboli (multiple peripheral nodules)

**Key Point:** **Mass-like consolidation in endemic area = biopsy** (exclude malignancy vs blastomycosis)

---

## TREATMENT

### **Mild-to-Moderate Pulmonary Blastomycosis:**

**Immunocompetent:**
- **Itraconazole** 200mg PO TID x 3 days (loading) → 200mg PO BID x 6-12 months
- **Alternative:** Fluconazole 400-800mg PO daily (less effective than itraconazole)

**Duration:** 6-12 months (until clinical/radiologic resolution)

**Key Point:** **Itraconazole = first-line for mild-to-moderate pulmonary blastomycosis**

---

### **Moderate-to-Severe Pulmonary Blastomycosis:**

**Criteria for Severe:**
- **Hypoxemia** (PaO₂ <70 mmHg)
- **ARDS**
- **Extensive infiltrates** (bilateral, multilobar)
- **Immunocompromised**

**Treatment:**
- **Amphotericin B** 0.7-1 mg/kg IV daily x 1-2 weeks (until improvement) → step down to itraconazole
- **Liposomal amphotericin B** 3-5 mg/kg IV daily (preferred - less nephrotoxicity)
- **Step down to itraconazole** 200mg PO BID x 6-12 months (total duration)

**Key Point:** **Amphotericin B for severe disease** → step down to itraconazole (total 6-12 months)

---

### **Disseminated Blastomycosis:**

**Non-CNS:**
- **Amphotericin B** 0.7-1 mg/kg IV daily x 1-2 weeks → itraconazole 200mg PO BID x 12 months

**CNS Involvement:**
- **Liposomal amphotericin B** 5 mg/kg IV daily x 4-6 weeks → itraconazole 200mg PO BID-TID x ≥12 months
- **Duration:** May require lifelong suppression if immunocompromised

**Key Point:** **CNS blastomycosis = prolonged amphotericin B** (4-6 weeks) → itraconazole ≥12 months

---

### **Cutaneous Blastomycosis Alone (Rare):**

**Localized Skin Lesions:**
- **Itraconazole** 200mg PO BID x 6-12 months
- **Always evaluate for pulmonary disease** (CXR, consider CT chest)

**Key Point:** **Always rule out pulmonary disease** in cutaneous blastomycosis (most have subclinical lung involvement)

---

## PROGNOSIS

**Untreated:**
- **High mortality** (25-40% in severe disease)
- **ARDS = very high mortality** (50-90% if untreated)

**Treated:**
- **Good response to treatment** (itraconazole, amphotericin B)
- **Mortality <5%** with appropriate therapy

**Immunocompromised:**
- **Higher mortality** (10-20%)
- **May require prolonged/lifelong suppression**

**Key Point:** **Early diagnosis + treatment = excellent prognosis** (mortality <5%)

---

## COMPLICATIONS

**Mnemonic: "ARDS-DISSEMINATE"**

**A**RDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome - severe pulmonary disease)
**R**elapse (if inadequate treatment duration)
**D**issemination (skin, bone, prostate, CNS)
**S**kin lesions (verrucous, mimics squamous cell carcinoma)

**D**elayed diagnosis (mimics malignancy)
**I**mmunocompromised (higher risk of dissemination)
**S**eptic shock (severe ARDS)
**S**keletal involvement (osteomyelitis, vertebral)
**E**pididymo-orchitis (GU dissemination)
**M**eningitis/brain abscess (CNS dissemination - rare)
**I**nadequate treatment (relapse risk)
**N**eed for prolonged therapy (6-12 months)
**A**cute life-threatening (ARDS, miliary disease)
**T**reatment with amphotericin B (severe disease)
**E**ndemic area clue (Great Lakes, Ohio/Mississippi Valley)

**Key Point:** **ARDS pattern in endemic area = consider disseminated blastomycosis** (high mortality)
