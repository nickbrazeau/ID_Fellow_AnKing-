## Pneumatoceles - Staph aureus & PCP

**Q:** What are pneumatoceles, which infections cause them, and what are their CT characteristics and clinical significance?

**A:**

## DEFINITION

**Pneumatocele:** **"Thin-walled air-filled cyst within lung parenchyma resulting from check-valve obstruction or parenchymal necrosis"**

**Wall thickness:** <4mm (usually <2mm)

**Key Point:** **Pneumatocele = thin-walled air-filled cyst** (complication of necrotizing infection or trauma)

---

## PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

**Formation Mechanisms:**

### **1. Check-Valve Mechanism (Staph aureus):**
1. **Bronchial/bronchiolar inflammation** → partial obstruction
2. **Air enters cyst during inspiration** (one-way valve)
3. **Air trapped during expiration** (cannot exit)
4. **Progressive enlargement** → pneumatocele

### **2. Parenchymal Necrosis (Staph, PCP):**
1. **Tissue necrosis** (necrotizing pneumonia, cytotoxins)
2. **Necrotic tissue evacuated** via bronchus
3. **Thin-walled cavity remains** (air-filled)
4. **Pneumatocele**

**Key Point:** **Check-valve or necrosis → thin-walled air-filled cyst**

## CAUSES

**Mnemonic: "STAPH-PCP-TRAUMA"**

**INFECTIOUS (Most Common):**

**S**taph aureus (most common - **#1 cause**, especially in children)
**T**oxic shock (PVL toxin - Panton-Valentine leukocidin)
**A**naerobes (necrotizing pneumonia, lung abscess)
**P**seudomonas aeruginosa (nosocomial, CF)
**H**. influenzae type b (Hib - pre-vaccine era)

**P**neumocystis jirovecii (PCP - HIV/immunocompromised)
**C**avitating pneumonia (Klebsiella)
**P**ost-influenza bacterial superinfection (S. aureus)

**NON-INFECTIOUS:**

**T**rauma (blunt chest trauma - most common non-infectious cause)
**R**espiratory distress (mechanical ventilation - barotrauma)
**A**spirated foreign body (check-valve obstruction)
**U**ncommon (hydrocarbon aspiration)
**M**echanical ventilation (barotrauma, PEEP)
**A**cute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS - barotrauma)

**Key Point:** **Staph aureus = #1 infectious cause** | **Trauma = #1 non-infectious cause**

---

## CT FINDINGS

**Hallmark: Thin-Walled Air-Filled Cysts**

### **Mnemonic: "THIN CYST"**

**T**hin walls (<4mm, usually <2mm)
**H**ydropneumothorax risk (if rupture)
**I**nternal air (no fluid level unless superinfected)
**N**ecrotizing pneumonia (underlying cause)

**C**ysts (single or multiple)
**Y**oung patients (children with Staph)
**S**taph aureus (most common cause)
**T**ransient (resolves over weeks to months)

---

## CHARACTERISTICS

**Size:** Variable (1-10cm, may enlarge rapidly)

**Number:**
- **Single** (70-80%)
- **Multiple** (20-30%)

**Location:**
- **Any lobe** (related to underlying pneumonia location)
- **Staph aureus:** Lower lobes > upper lobes
- **PCP:** Upper lobes > lower lobes

**Wall:** Smooth, very thin (<2mm)

**Contents:**
- **Air** (no fluid level unless superinfected)
- **May have thin internal septations**

**Appearance:**
- **Round or ovoid**
- **Well-defined margins**

**Key Point:** **Thin-walled, round, air-filled cysts** (single or multiple)

---

## STAPH AUREUS PNEUMONIA

**Clinical Context:**
- **Post-influenza** (1-4 weeks after viral illness)
- **Children <2 years** (before pneumococcal vaccine)
- **IVDU** (endocarditis with septic emboli)
- **CA-MRSA** (PVL toxin - Panton-Valentine leukocidin)

**CT Findings:**
- **Bilateral patchy consolidation** (bronchopneumonia pattern)
- **Pneumatoceles** (develop 1-2 weeks after illness onset)
- **Cavitation** (thick-walled initially, then thin-walled)
- **Empyema** (common complication)

**Key Point:** **Post-influenza pneumonia + pneumatoceles = Staph aureus**

---

## PCP (PNEUMOCYSTIS PNEUMONIA)

**Clinical Context:**
- **HIV** (CD4 <200)
- **Immunocompromised** (transplant, steroids)

**CT Findings:**
- **Ground-glass opacities** (bilateral, perihilar)
- **Thin-walled cysts** (develop during treatment - immune reconstitution)
- **Upper lobe predominance** (cysts)
- **Pneumothorax risk** (35% if cysts present)

**Key Point:** **PCP cysts develop during treatment** (immune reconstitution, week 2-4)

---

## COMPLICATIONS

**Mnemonic: "RUPTURE"**

**R**upture into pleural space (pneumothorax, pyopneumothorax)
**U**nstable (may enlarge rapidly)
**P**neumothorax (most common complication - 10-30%)
**T**ension pneumothorax (if large rupture)
**U**sually resolves (2-12 months)
**R**arely superinfected (becomes lung abscess)
**E**mpyema (if infected contents rupture into pleura)

**Key Point:** **Pneumothorax = most common complication** (10-30% of cases)

## PNEUMATOCELE vs LUNG ABSCESS

| **Feature** | **Pneumatocele** | **Lung Abscess** |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Wall thickness** | **Thin (<4mm, usually <2mm)** | **Thick (>4mm)** |
| **Air-fluid level** | **Absent** (unless superinfected) | **Present** |
| **Internal lining** | **Smooth** | **Shaggy, irregular** |
| **Resolution** | **Resolves (weeks to months)** | **Resolves slowly** (4-8 weeks) |
| **Cause** | **Necrotizing infection, check-valve** | **Anaerobic infection, aspiration** |
| **Treatment** | **Observation** (usually) | **Prolonged antibiotics** |

**Key Point:** **Thin wall + no fluid level = pneumatocele** | **Thick wall + air-fluid level = abscess**

---

## PNEUMATOCELE vs TRAUMATIC PNEUMATOCELE

**Infectious Pneumatocele:**
- **History of pneumonia** (Staph, PCP)
- **Develops during or after pneumonia** (1-2 weeks)
- **Associated with consolidation**

**Traumatic Pneumatocele:**
- **History of blunt chest trauma**
- **Develops acutely** (within 24-72 hours of trauma)
- **Associated with contusion, rib fractures**
- **Resolves faster** (4-8 weeks)

**Key Point:** **History distinguishes** (pneumonia vs trauma)

---

## MANAGEMENT

**Observation (Most Cases):**
- **Asymptomatic pneumatocele:** No treatment
- **Serial imaging** (CXR or CT) - ensure stability or resolution
- **Spontaneous resolution:** 2-12 months (avg 3-6 months)

**Treatment of Underlying Infection:**
- **Staph aureus:** Vancomycin or linezolid (if MRSA)
- **PCP:** TMP-SMX (continue despite pneumatocele development)

**Drainage (Rarely Needed):**
- **Symptomatic enlargement** (respiratory distress)
- **Superinfection** (air-fluid level develops → abscess)
- **Pneumothorax** (chest tube for PTX, not for pneumatocele itself)

**Surgery (Very Rare):**
- **Persistent pneumatocele** (>6-12 months)
- **Recurrent pneumothorax**
- **Superinfected pneumatocele** (not responding to antibiotics)

**Key Point:** **Most resolve spontaneously** (observation, no drainage needed)

---

## PROGNOSIS

**Resolution:**
- **70-80% resolve spontaneously** within 6 months
- **90-95% resolve** within 12 months
- **Residual thin-walled cyst** (<5%)

**Complications:**
- **Pneumothorax:** 10-30% (especially PCP)
- **Superinfection:** <5% (becomes abscess)
- **Persistent pneumatocele:** <5% (may require surgery)

**Mortality:**
- **Related to underlying infection** (not pneumatocele itself)
- **Staph aureus pneumonia:** 10-20%
- **PCP with PTX:** 30-40%

**Key Point:** **Benign course** (most resolve spontaneously without intervention)

---

**Clinical Pearls:**
- **Pneumatocele = thin-walled air-filled cyst** (<4mm, usually <2mm)
- **Staph aureus = #1 infectious cause** (post-influenza, necrotizing pneumonia)
- **PCP cysts develop during treatment** (immune reconstitution, week 2-4)
- **Post-influenza pneumonia + pneumatoceles = Staph aureus**
- **Thin wall + no fluid level = pneumatocele** | **Thick wall + air-fluid level = abscess**
- **Pneumothorax = most common complication** (10-30%, especially PCP)
- **Most resolve spontaneously** (70-80% within 6 months, no drainage needed)
- **Observation = treatment of choice** (serial imaging)
- **Continue antibiotics for underlying infection** (don't stop due to pneumatocele)
- **CA-MRSA with PVL toxin = necrotizing pneumonia** → pneumatoceles

**Media:**

**Image 1 - Pneumatoceles (Staph Aureus):**

*CXR of a 4-year-old child 2 weeks post-influenza presenting with fever and respiratory distress. Note multiple thin-walled air-filled cysts (pneumatoceles) in both lower lobes with background consolidation. Blood culture grew MRSA (CA-MRSA with PVL toxin). Treated with vancomycin, pneumatoceles resolved over 4 months.*

**Image 2 - Pneumatoceles (CT):**

*CT chest showing multiple thin-walled (<2mm) air-filled cysts bilaterally. Patient is a 35-year-old IVDU with Staph aureus endocarditis and septic emboli to lungs. Pneumatoceles developed during treatment. Observed with serial imaging, resolved in 6 months without drainage.*

**Image 3 - PCP with Cysts and Pneumothorax:**

*CT showing multiple thin-walled cysts in upper lobes with background ground-glass opacities in HIV patient (CD4 50) being treated for PCP. Patient developed right pneumothorax (arrow) requiring chest tube. Cysts appeared on day 10 of TMP-SMX treatment (immune reconstitution).*

**Image 4 - Pneumatocele vs Lung Abscess:**

*(A) Pneumatocele - very thin wall (<2mm), smooth, no air-fluid level, resolves spontaneously. (B) Lung abscess - thick irregular wall (>4mm), air-fluid level present, requires prolonged antibiotics.*
