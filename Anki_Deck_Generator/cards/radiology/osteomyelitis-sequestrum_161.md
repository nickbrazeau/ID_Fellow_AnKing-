## Osteomyelitis - Sequestrum

**Q:** What is a sequestrum, what are its characteristic imaging features on X-ray and CT, and why is its presence critical for surgical planning?

**A:**

## DEFINITION

**Sequestrum:** **"Fragment of dead (necrotic) bone separated from living bone by granulation tissue"**

**Imaging Hallmark:** **Dense sclerotic bone fragment surrounded by lucency**

**Key Point:** **Sequestrum = chronic osteomyelitis** (hallmark finding, >4-6 weeks)

---

## PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

**Formation of Sequestrum:**

**Mnemonic: "DEATH-SEPARATION-INVOLUCRUM"**

**D**ead bone (necrotic from infection)
**E**levated periosteum (stripped by pus, disrupts blood supply)
**A**vascular bone fragment (dies without blood supply)
**T**hrombus (septic thrombophlebitis, infarcts bone)
**H**allmark of chronic infection

**S**eparated from living bone (granulation tissue border)
**E**xposed bone (medullary blood supply lost)
**P**us under periosteum (disrupts periosteal vessels)
**A**cutoff perfusion (ischemia → necrosis)
**R**emains as dead fragment
**A**ppears dense on imaging (no resorption)
**T**rap for bacteria (biofilm formation)
**I**mmune cells cannot reach (avascular)
**O**steoclasts cannot resorb (avascular)
**N**o antibiotic penetration (avascular)

**I**nvolucrum forms around sequestrum (new bone shell)
**N**ew bone (periosteum lays down)
**V**iable bone (surrounds dead bone)
**O**uter shell (contains infection)
**L**oculated pus (between involucrum and sequestrum)
**U**nder new bone (pus drains through cloaca)
**C**hronic infection (sequestrum harbors bacteria)
**R**equires surgical removal
**U**nresponsive to antibiotics alone
**M**ust be excised surgically

**Key Point:** **Sequestrum = avascular dead bone** (antibiotics cannot penetrate, bacteria persist in biofilm)

---

## IMAGING CHARACTERISTICS

**Hallmark: Dense (Sclerotic) Bone Fragment Surrounded by Lucency**

### **Mnemonic: "DENSE-SURROUNDED-INVOLUCRUM"**

**X-RAY:**

**D**ense bone fragment (sclerotic, whiter than normal bone)
**E**nhanced density (dead bone not resorbed by osteoclasts)
**N**o vascular supply (avascular necrosis)
**S**urrounded by lucency (granulation tissue, pus)
**E**nduring fragment (persists over time)

**S**clerotic appearance (dense, white on X-ray)
**U**sually irregular shape
**R**adiopaque (denser than surrounding bone)
**R**esidual fragment (after bone destruction)
**O**lder than 4-6 weeks (chronic)
**U**nattached to living bone
**N**o periosteal blood supply
**D**ead cortical or cancellous bone
**E**nclosed by involucrum
**D**etached from viable bone

**I**nvolucrum (new bone shell around sequestrum)
**N**ew periosteal bone formation
**V**iable bone (enhances on MRI)
**O**uter envelope (contains infection)
**L**ucency between involucrum and sequestrum (pus)
**U**nder involucrum (sequestrum trapped)
**C**loaca (hole in involucrum for drainage)
**R**ing of new bone
**U**sually thicker than original cortex
**M**ultiple layers (onion-skin)

**Key Point:** **Dense bone fragment + surrounding lucency + involucrum = sequestrum**

---

## CT FINDINGS (Best Modality for Sequestrum)

**CT = Gold Standard for Detecting Sequestrum**

**Findings:**
- **Dense bone fragment** (Hounsfield units >400-600)
- **Surrounded by low density** (fluid, granulation tissue <50 HU)
- **Involucrum** (thickened cortex, periosteal new bone)
- **Cloaca** (sinus tract through involucrum - path for pus to drain)
- **Soft tissue abscess** (adjacent fluid collection)

**Advantages of CT:**
- **Superior bone detail** (better than MRI for cortical bone)
- **Detects small sequestra** (high spatial resolution)
- **Surgical planning** (extent of debridement needed)
- **Differentiates sequestrum from involucrum** (density differences)

**Key Point:** **CT best modality for sequestrum** (superior bone detail, surgical planning)

---

## MRI FINDINGS

**MRI Appearance:**
- **T1: Hypointense** (low signal - avascular, no marrow)
- **T2: Hypointense** (low signal - densely sclerotic)
- **Post-contrast: No enhancement** (avascular - confirms dead bone)
- **Surrounded by enhancing granulation tissue** (rim of enhancement)

**Surrounding Findings:**
- **Involucrum enhances** (viable bone)
- **Bone marrow edema** (T2 hyperintense in adjacent viable bone)
- **Soft tissue abscess** (rim-enhancing fluid collection)
- **Cloaca/sinus tract** (T2 hyperintense track to skin)

**Key Point:** **Sequestrum on MRI = no enhancement** (avascular dead bone)

---

## INVOLUCRUM

**Involucrum:** **"Shell of new bone formed by periosteum around sequestrum"**

**Characteristics:**
- **Living bone** (vascularized, enhances on MRI)
- **Periosteal origin** (lifted periosteum lays down new bone)
- **Surrounds sequestrum** (encases dead bone + pus)
- **May be thicker than original cortex**
- **Perforated by cloacae** (holes for pus drainage)

**Key Point:** **Involucrum = living bone shell** (enhances on MRI, vascularized)

---

## CLOACA

**Cloaca:** **"Opening/sinus tract through involucrum that drains pus to skin surface"**

**Characteristics:**
- **Latin: "sewer"**
- **Drains pus** from between sequestrum and involucrum
- **Visible on imaging** (CT, MRI)
- **Chronic draining sinus** clinically (opening on skin)
- **May develop squamous cell carcinoma** (rare, after decades - 0.2-1.5%)

**Key Point:** **Cloaca = drainage tract through involucrum** (chronic draining sinus)

---

## TIMING OF SEQUESTRUM FORMATION

**Acute Osteomyelitis (0-2 weeks):**
- **No sequestrum** (too early for bone death/separation)

**Subacute Osteomyelitis (2-6 weeks):**
- **Early sequestrum formation** (bone death occurs, not yet well-defined)

**Chronic Osteomyelitis (>6 weeks):**
- **Well-formed sequestrum** (dense, separated)
- **Involucrum formation** (periosteal new bone)
- **Cloaca formation** (draining tract)

**Key Point:** **Sequestrum visible after 4-6 weeks** (hallmark of chronic infection)

---

## CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE

**Why Sequestrum Matters:**

**Mnemonic: "BIOFILM-AVASCULAR-SURGERY"**

**B**iofilm formation (bacteria form protective biofilm on dead bone)
**I**mpermeable to antibiotics (avascular, no drug penetration)
**O**steoclasts cannot reach (avascular)
**F**ails medical therapy alone (antibiotics insufficient)
**I**nfection persists (chronic, relapsing)
**L**iving bacteria (protected within biofilm)
**M**ust remove surgically

**A**vascular (no blood supply)
**V**iable bone not reached by antibiotics
**A**ntibiotics cannot penetrate
**S**eptic focus (nidus of infection)
**C**hronic infection reservoir
**U**nreachable by immune cells
**L**acks blood vessels
**A**bsolutely requires removal
**R**efractory to antibiotics alone

**S**urgical debridement mandatory
**U**nable to cure without removal
**R**emoval (sequestrectomy) required
**G**ranulation tissue removed (debrided)
**E**xcise all dead bone
**R**efractory infection if retained
**Y**ields recurrence if not removed

**Key Point:** **Sequestrum must be removed surgically** (antibiotics cannot penetrate avascular bone)

---

## DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

**Other Dense Bone Fragments:**

**Mnemonic: "SEQUESTRUM-FRACTURE-FOREIGN"**

**Sequestrum (Chronic Osteomyelitis):**
- **Dense fragment** + surrounding lucency + involucrum
- **Chronic draining sinus** (clinical)
- **Irregular shape**

**Bone Fragment (Healed Fracture):**
- **History of trauma**
- **No surrounding lucency** (healed, united)
- **No soft tissue changes**

**Foreign Body:**
- **History of penetrating trauma**
- **May be metallic** (gunshot, shrapnel)
- **Different density** (metal >1000 HU)

**Bone Island (Enostosis):**
- **Benign** (not infection)
- **No surrounding lucency**
- **Trabecular pattern** (feathered edges)
- **Stable over time**

**Key Point:** **Sequestrum distinguished by surrounding lucency + involucrum + clinical context**

---

## TREATMENT

**Surgical Removal (Sequestrectomy):**

**Indications:**
- **ALL sequestra must be removed** (medical therapy alone fails)
- **Chronic osteomyelitis with sequestrum = surgical disease**

**Surgical Steps:**
1. **Debride dead bone** (remove sequestrum)
2. **Remove surrounding granulation tissue**
3. **Curette/burr viable bone** (expose healthy bleeding bone)
4. **Irrigate copiously**
5. **Consider antibiotic beads** (local delivery)
6. **May need multiple debridements**

**Post-Operative:**
- **Prolonged IV antibiotics** (6-12 weeks)
- **Wound VAC** (negative pressure wound therapy if large defect)
- **May need bone grafting** (if large defect)
- **May need flap coverage** (if extensive soft tissue loss)

**Key Point:** **Sequestrectomy + prolonged antibiotics = treatment for chronic osteomyelitis**

---

## PROGNOSIS

**With Adequate Surgical Debridement:**
- **Cure rate:** 70-90%
- **Recurrence:** 10-20%

**Without Sequestrum Removal:**
- **Cure rate:** <20% (antibiotics alone fail)
- **Recurrence:** >80%
- **Chronic relapsing course**

**Factors Affecting Outcome:**
- **Complete removal** (all dead bone excised)
- **Adequate antibiotic duration** (6-12 weeks)
- **Vascular supply** (poor prognosis if peripheral vascular disease)
- **Patient factors** (diabetes, immunosuppression worse prognosis)

**Key Point:** **Inadequate debridement = recurrence** (must remove all dead bone)

---

## COMPLICATIONS

**Mnemonic: "RECURRENCE-MALIGNANCY-AMPUTATION"**

**R**ecurrence (if inadequate debridement, 10-30%)
**E**xtensive bone loss (may need bone graft)
**C**hronic draining sinus (persists if sequestrum remains)
**U**ncontrolled infection (sepsis)
**R**efractory to antibiotics (if sequestrum retained)
**R**esidual deformity (limb shortening, angular deformity)
**E**nduring pain (chronic)
**N**eed for multiple surgeries
**C**ontracture (joint stiffness)
**E**xtensive tissue loss

**M**alignancy (squamous cell carcinoma in chronic sinus tract - 0.2-1.5%)
**A**mputatio (if refractory, diabetic foot - last resort)
**L**imb length discrepancy (children - growth plate damage)
**I**nadequate healing (non-union)
**G**rowth disturbance (physeal damage)
**N**eurovascularpathy compromise
**A**myloidosis (rare, chronic inflammation)
**N**ecrosis (extensive tissue loss)
**C**hronic osteomyelitis (recurrent)
**Y**ielding to sepsis

**A**mputation (if refractory diabetic foot osteomyelitis)
**M**ultiple surgeries (may require staged debridements)
**P**athologic fracture (through weakened bone)
**U**nhealed wound (chronic)
**T**issue defects (require reconstruction)
**A**bscess formation (soft tissue, recurrent)
**T**hrombosis (septic)

**O**steonecrosis (progressive bone death)
**N**eed for long-term antibiotics

**Key Point:** **Chronic sinus tracts (decades) → squamous cell carcinoma** (rare, 0.2-1.5%)
