## Tuberculosis - Cavitation (Chest Radiology)

**Q:** What are the characteristic radiographic features of tuberculosis cavitation on chest X-ray and CT, including typical location, cavity characteristics, and associated findings?

**A:**

## LOCATION

**Classic Distribution: "Upper Lobes" (Post-Primary TB)**

- **85% occur in posterior segments of upper lobes**
- **Apicoposterior segments** (upper lobes) and **superior segments** (lower lobes)
- **Upper zone predominance** (hallmark of reactivation/post-primary TB)

**Key Point:** **Post-primary TB = upper lobe cavitation** (vs primary TB = any location, rarely cavitates)

---

## CAVITY CHARACTERISTICS

### **Cavitation Frequency:**

| **TB Type** | **Cavitation Frequency** |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| **Primary TB** | **10-30%** (uncommon, requires immunocompromise) |
| **Post-primary (Reactivation) TB** | **20-45%** (much more common) |

**Key Point:** **Cavitation strongly suggests post-primary (reactivation) TB**

---

### **Cavity Appearance on Imaging:**

**Chest X-ray:**
- **Thick-walled cavity** (>2-4mm wall thickness if active)
- **Upper lobe location** (posterior segment)
- **Air-fluid level** (if communication with airway → **contagious**)
- **Surrounding consolidation or nodular opacities**

**CT Findings:**
- **Well-demarcated cavity** with irregular thick walls (active disease)
- **Air-fluid level** indicates endobronchial communication (↑ infectivity)
- **Variable wall thickness:**
  - **Thick-walled** (>4mm) → active infection
  - **Thin-walled** → healing/chronic cavitation
- **Surrounding tree-in-bud pattern** (endobronchial spread)

**Key Point:** **Air-fluid level = communication with airway = highly contagious**

---

## ASSOCIATED FINDINGS (Endobronchial Spread)

**Mnemonic: "CATCH TB"**
- **C**avitation (thick-walled, upper lobe)
- **A**picoposterior segments (85% location)
- **T**ree-in-bud pattern (2-4mm centrilobular nodules)
- **C**onsolidation (patchy, surrounding cavity)
- **H**ilar lymphadenopathy (~33% of post-primary cases)

---

### **Tree-in-bud Pattern:**

**Description:** **2-4mm centrilobular nodules** with **branching linear opacities** (resembles tree branches with buds)

**Significance:**
- Indicates **active endobronchial spread**
- **AFB-positive sputum likely**
- **High infectivity**

**Key Point:** **Tree-in-bud = endobronchial dissemination = contagious**

---

## DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF UPPER LOBE CAVITATION

**Mnemonic: "CAVITY"**
- **C**ancer (squamous cell carcinoma, metastases)
- **A**spergillosis (fungal ball in pre-existing cavity)
- **V**asculitis (Wegener's granulomatosis → GPA)
- **I**nfection (TB, Nocardia, Klebsiella, anaerobic abscess)
- **T**hromboembolic (septic emboli from endocarditis/IVDU)
- **Y**outh (congenital cysts, sequestration)

**Key Distinguishing Features for TB:**
- **Upper lobe location** (posterior segments)
- **Tree-in-bud pattern** (endobronchial spread)
- **Multiple cavities or consolidation**
- **Risk factors:** HIV, immunosuppression, endemic exposure, homelessness, incarceration

## PRIMARY TB vs POST-PRIMARY TB CAVITATION

| **Feature** | **Primary TB** | **Post-Primary (Reactivation) TB** |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Cavitation frequency** | 10-30% (uncommon) | 20-45% (common) |
| **Location** | Any lobe (often middle/lower) | **Upper lobes (85% posterior segments)** |
| **Lymphadenopathy** | **Prominent** (hallmark) | Less common (~33%) |
| **Pleural effusion** | **Common** | Less common |
| **Endobronchial spread** | Rare | **Common (tree-in-bud)** |
| **Infectivity** | Low (unless cavitates) | **High (especially if cavitates)** |

**Key Point:** **Primary TB = lymphadenopathy > cavitation** | **Post-primary TB = cavitation > lymphadenopathy**

---

## CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE

**Cavitation Indicates:**
1. **Active TB** (thick-walled cavity)
2. **Endobronchial communication** (if air-fluid level present)
3. **High bacillary burden** (AFB smear likely positive)
4. **Increased infectivity** (respiratory isolation required)
5. **Longer treatment duration** (monitor for response)

**Key Point:** **Cavity with air-fluid level = highly contagious (airborne precautions)**

---

## RADIOGRAPHIC PATTERNS TO REMEMBER

**Post-Primary TB Classic Triad:**
1. **Upper lobe cavitation** (thick-walled)
2. **Tree-in-bud pattern** (endobronchial spread)
3. **Patchy consolidation** (surrounding cavity)

**Key Point:** **Upper lobe cavity + tree-in-bud = post-primary TB until proven otherwise**

---

**Clinical Pearls:**
- **85% of TB cavities occur in posterior segments of upper lobes**
- **Post-primary TB cavitates 20-45% of the time** (vs primary TB 10-30%)
- **Air-fluid level = communication with airway = highly contagious**
- **Tree-in-bud pattern = active endobronchial spread = AFB smear likely positive**
- **Thick-walled cavity (>4mm) = active infection** (vs thin-walled = chronic/healing)
- **Upper lobe cavity + tree-in-bud = TB until proven otherwise**
- **Always check for pleural effusion** (suggests active disease or empyema)
- **Cavitation requires respiratory isolation** (airborne precautions)
