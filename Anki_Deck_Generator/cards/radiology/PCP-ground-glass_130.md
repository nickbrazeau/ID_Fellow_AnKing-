## Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia (PCP) - Ground-Glass Opacities

**Q:** What are the characteristic CT findings of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), including the classic ground-glass opacity pattern, distribution, and associated features?

**A:**

## CLASSIC CT FINDINGS

**Hallmark: Bilateral Ground-Glass Opacities (GGO)**

**Definition:** **"Hazy increased lung attenuation with preserved bronchial and vascular markings"**

**Distribution:**
- **Bilateral, symmetric**
- **Perihilar predominance** ("bat-wing" distribution)
- **Diffuse** (may spare periphery initially)
- **Upper lobe sparing** (if on aerosolized pentamidine prophylaxis)

**Key Point:** **Ground-glass opacities = 100% sensitive for PCP** (if absent, PCP unlikely)

---

## PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF GROUND-GLASS APPEARANCE

**Histopathology:**
- **Alveolar exudation** (foamy eosinophilic material)
- **Organisms in alveolar spaces** (*P. jirovecii* trophozoites and cysts)
- **Interstitial inflammation** (lymphocytes, plasma cells)
- **Fibrin + cellular debris accumulation**

**Ground-glass = partial alveolar filling** (not completely consolidated)

**Key Point:** **GGO represents alveolitis** (organisms + exudate + inflammation)

---

## CT PATTERNS OF PCP

### **Mnemonic: "PCP GROUND"**

**P**erihilar distribution (classic "bat-wing")
**C**razy-paving pattern (GGO + interlobular septal thickening)
**P**neumothorax (if cysts rupture - 6-35%)

**G**round-glass opacities (bilateral, symmetric) - **HALLMARK**
**R**eticular opacities (interstitial pattern)
**O**pacity distribution (diffuse, perihilar > peripheral)
**U**pper lobe sparing (if on aerosolized pentamidine)
**N**odules (if granulomatous PCP - rare)
**D**iffuse (bilateral involvement)

---

## IMAGING FEATURES BY MODALITY

### **Chest X-ray:**

**Classic Appearance:**
- **Bilateral interstitial infiltrates** (fine reticular pattern)
- **Perihilar hazy opacities** ("bat-wing")
- **May be NORMAL** (10-30% early in disease, especially if CD4 >200)

**Key Point:** **Normal CXR does NOT rule out PCP** (CT more sensitive)

---

### **High-Resolution CT (HRCT):**

**Typical Findings (>90% of cases):**
1. **Ground-glass opacities** (bilateral, symmetric)
2. **Perihilar predominance**
3. **Reticular pattern** (thickened interlobular septa)
4. **Crazy-paving pattern** (GGO + septal thickening - 10-30%)
5. **Preserved architecture** (no mass effect, no lymphadenopathy)

**Atypical Findings (5-10%):**
- **Thin-walled cysts** (2-5mm, predispose to pneumothorax)
- **Nodules or consolidation** (granulomatous PCP)
- **Upper lobe predominance** (aerosolized pentamidine prophylaxis)
- **Asymmetric distribution** (rare)

**Key Point:** **HRCT 100% sensitive** (if negative, consider alternative diagnosis)

---

## CRAZY-PAVING PATTERN

**Definition:** **"Ground-glass opacities with superimposed interlobular septal thickening"**

**Appearance:** Resembles irregular paving stones

**Differential Diagnosis of Crazy-Paving:**
- **PCP** (HIV patients)
- **Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis** (PAP)
- **Pulmonary edema** (cardiogenic, ARDS)
- **Mucinous adenocarcinoma**
- **Organizing pneumonia**
- **Lipoid pneumonia**

**Key Point:** **Crazy-paving in HIV patient = PCP** (until proven otherwise)

---

## CYSTIC PCP

**Thin-Walled Cysts:**
- **Size:** 2-10mm diameter
- **Location:** Upper lobes > lower lobes
- **Number:** Multiple (usually >20)
- **Wall thickness:** <2mm (thin-walled)
- **Associated with:** Pneumothorax risk

**Pneumothorax in PCP:**
- **Incidence:** 6% overall, **35% if cysts present**
- **Mechanism:** Cyst rupture into pleural space
- **Often bilateral**
- **Refractory to chest tube** (may require pleurodesis or surgery)
- **High mortality** (especially if on mechanical ventilation)

**Key Point:** **Cysts in PCP = high pneumothorax risk** (35% if cysts present)

---

## PATIENT POPULATION

**High-Risk for PCP:**

**Mnemonic: "HIV TRANSPLANT"**

**H**IV (CD4 <200 - **highest risk**)
**I**mmunosuppressive drugs (steroids >20mg/day x 1 month, calcineurin inhibitors)
**V**asculitis treatment (cyclophosphamide, rituximab)

**T**ransplant recipients (solid organ, hematopoietic stem cell)
**R**heumatologic disease (on immunosuppression)
**A**utoimmune disorders (lupus, dermatomyositis)
**N**eoplasms (lymphoma, leukemia, especially with chemotherapy)
**S**teroids (high-dose, prolonged >3 weeks)
**P**rophylaxis not used (non-adherence)
**L**ung disease (chronic, on immunosuppression)
**A**cute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL - especially during induction)
**N**eutropenia (prolonged)
**T**NF-α inhibitors (biologics)

**Key Point:** **CD4 <200 = highest risk** (prophylaxis indicated)

---

## CLINICAL PRESENTATION

**Classic Triad:**
1. **Subacute dyspnea** (weeks, insidious onset)
2. **Dry cough** (non-productive)
3. **Fever** (low-grade)

**Physical Exam:**
- **Hypoxemia** (↓ O₂ saturation, especially with exertion)
- **Tachypnea**
- **Lung exam often normal** (or fine crackles)
- **LDH elevated** (>500 U/L - sensitive but non-specific)

**Key Point:** **PCP = subacute dyspnea + dry cough + hypoxemia** (in immunocompromised host)

---

## DIAGNOSIS

**Gold Standard:** **Induced sputum OR bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) + staining**

**Staining Methods:**
- **Gro cott methenamine silver (GMS)** - visualizes cyst forms
- **Toluidine blue O**
- **Giemsa** - visualizes trophozoites
- **Immunofluorescence** (more sensitive)

**Molecular Testing:**
- **PCR** (highly sensitive, but positive if colonization - must correlate clinically)
- **β-D-glucan** (serum) - >80 pg/mL suggestive (not specific)

**Key Point:** **BAL with GMS staining = gold standard** (>90% sensitive)

---

## DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF BILATERAL GGO

**Mnemonic: "GROUND GLASS"**

**G**ranulomatosis with polyangiitis (vasculitis)
**R**espiratory viral pneumonia (CMV, influenza, COVID-19)
**O**rganizing pneumonia (COP)
**U**remic pulmonary edema
**N**on-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ARDS)
**D**rug-induced pneumonitis (amiodarone, methotrexate)

**G**ranulomatous PCP (atypical, nodular pattern)
**L**ipoid pneumonia (aspiration of mineral oil)
**A**lveolar proteinosis (PAP - crazy-paving)
**S**eptic emboli (multiple peripheral nodules)
**S**arcoidosis (nodular, lymphadenopathy)

**Key Point:** **HIV + GGO + hypoxemia = PCP** (until proven otherwise)

---

## UPPER LOBE SPARING

**If on Aerosolized Pentamidine Prophylaxis:**

- **Upper lobes relatively spared** (drug doesn't reach apices well)
- **Lower lobe + perihilar GGO**
- **Atypical distribution** (suggests prophylaxis failure)

**Key Point:** **Upper lobe sparing = aerosolized pentamidine prophylaxis**

---

## TREATMENT & IMAGING RESPONSE

**First-Line Treatment:**
- **Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)** 15-20 mg/kg/day (TMP component) PO/IV
- **Duration:** 21 days (HIV), 14 days (non-HIV)
- **Adjunctive steroids** if PaO₂ <70 mmHg or A-a gradient >35

**Imaging Response:**
- **Ground-glass opacities improve** over 4-8 weeks
- **Cysts may persist** (or develop during treatment)
- **Pneumothorax can occur** during treatment (immune reconstitution)

**Key Point:** **GGO resolves slowly** (weeks) even with effective treatment

---

**Clinical Pearls:**
- **Ground-glass opacities = 100% sensitive for PCP** (absence makes PCP unlikely)
- **Classic distribution: Bilateral, symmetric, perihilar ("bat-wing")**
- **Crazy-paving pattern** (GGO + septal thickening) highly suggestive in HIV
- **Thin-walled cysts = pneumothorax risk** (6% overall, 35% if cysts present)
- **Normal CXR in 10-30% early PCP** (CT much more sensitive)
- **HRCT is 100% sensitive** (if negative, consider alternative)
- **Highest risk: CD4 <200** (prophylaxis indicated with TMP-SMX)
- **Upper lobe sparing suggests aerosolized pentamidine prophylaxis**
- **Diagnosis: BAL + GMS staining** (gold standard, >90% sensitive)
- **LDH elevated** (>500 U/L) - sensitive but non-specific
- **Treatment: TMP-SMX 21 days + steroids** if severe hypoxemia
- **Differential:** viral pneumonia, ARDS, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, organizing pneumonia
- **Pneumothorax in PCP refractory to chest tube** (may need pleurodesis/surgery)
