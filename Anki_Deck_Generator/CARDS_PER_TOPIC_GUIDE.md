- Card 8: Pneumonia and necrotizing pneumonia
- Card 9: Osteomyelitis and prosthetic joint infections
- Card 10: MRSA treatment options (vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, ceftaroline)

## 📋 Decision Framework

### **For Each Topic, Ask:**

1. **How many distinct clinical entities?**
   - Single presentation: 3-5 cards
   - Multiple presentations: 5-8 cards
   - Highly diverse: 8-10 cards

2. **How complex is diagnosis?**
   - Simple test: 1 card
   - Algorithm needed: 2-3 cards
   - Multiple approaches: 3-4 cards

3. **How many treatment options?**
   - Single drug: 1 card
   - Multiple regimens: 2-3 cards
   - Complex decision tree: 3-4 cards

4. **How important clinically?**
   - Rare/low-yield: Minimum cards
   - Common/board-relevant: More cards
   - High-stakes (e.g., meningitis): Maximum cards

## ⚖️ Quality > Quantity

**Better to have:**
- 5 excellent cards with mnemonics and images
- Clear, focused questions
- Evidence-based, cited answers

**Than:**
- 10 mediocre cards
- Overlapping content
- Vague or unsourced information

---

## 🎯 Practical Workflow

### **Starting a New Topic:**

1. **Survey the topic** (PubMed, guidelines, repository PDFs)
2. **Identify key concepts** (5-10 distinct learnable items)
3. **Group into cards:**
   - Microbiology/basics
   - Clinical presentation
   - Diagnosis
   - Treatment
   - Complications/pearls
4. **Generate cards** with mnemonics and images
5. **Mark topic complete** when adequately covered

### **When to Move On:**

✅ **Move to next topic when:**
- Core concepts covered (microbiology → diagnosis → treatment)
- Evidence-based content with citations
- Mnemonics/images included
- No major gaps in clinical reasoning flow

❌ **Don't:**
- Force exactly 5 cards if topic needs 3 or 8
- Create redundant cards to hit a number
- Skip important aspects to move faster
